    <p class="p6 large center">JOHNNY NELSON</p>


    <h2 id="I">CHAPTER I</h2>

    <p class="center">A ROLLING STONE</p></div>


<p class="center">The horse stopped suddenly and her rider came
    to his senses with a jerk, his hand streaking to
    a six-gun, while he muttered a profane inquiry at
    he swiftly scrutinized his surroundings. Had it been
    any horse but Pepper he would have directed his suspicions
    at it, but he knew the animal too well to do it
    that injustice. The valley before and below him was
    heavily grassed, and throughout its entire length wandered
    a small stream. Grazing cattle were scattered
    along it, and riding up the farther slope were three
    men, who appeared to be peaceful and innocent of
    wrong intent. These his eyes swept past, and they
    passed a small cluster of bowlders down on the slope
    below him, but instantly returned to them, a puzzled
    look appearing upon his face. In that nest of rocks
    a woman lay prone, peering at the distant horsemen,
    and she slowly brought a rifle to her shoulder, cuddling
    its stock against her cheek. What he did not see, and
    could not, at that angle, was the menacing head of a
    rattlesnake not twenty feet from her, the instinctive
    fear of which put a chill in her heart and urged her
    to shoot it, even at the risk of being heard by the men
    she was watching. Johnny Nelson unconsciously esti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>mated
    the range and shook his head. He could do it
    with his Sharp's single-shot, a rifle of great power; but
    he had yet to see any repeater that could. Knowing
    the futility of a shot, he coughed loudly, and had the
    satisfaction of seeing a flurry below him, and a rifle
    muzzle at the same instant. Slowly he raised his hands
    level with his shoulders, spoke to the horse and, mustering
    all the dignity possible under the circumstances,
    rode slowly down the slope.</p>

<p>"That's far enough," said a crisp voice, pleasant in
    timbre even though business-like and angry. "Haven't
    I told you punchers to keep off this ranch?"</p>

<p>"Never to my knowledge, Ma'am," he answered.</p>

<p>"Have you the brazen effrontery to sit there and
    calmly tell me that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Ma'am; but I never heard about no
    such orders."</p>

<p>"Who are you? Where do you come from? What
    are you doing here?"</p>

<p>Johnny smiled apologetically. "Fifteen hundred
    shore would strain that gun. Ma'am. An' mostly a
    shot wasted is worse than none at all. I'm here to
    offer you one that bites hard at that distance, 'though
    I can't say I generally recommend it for ladies�it
    kicks powerful hard, heavy as it is."</p>

<p>"Answer my questions. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"A stranger, Ma'am; a pilgrim, seekin' what I can
    devour. But now it's nearer sixteen hundred," he suggested,
    lowering a hand to get the Sharp's from its
    sheath under his leg.</p>

<p>"That will do!" she warned. "The range which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
    interests me is ten yards. You may rest them on your
    hat," she conceded.</p>

<p>He locked his fingers over his head and grinned.
    "Why, I'm a rollin' stone from Montanny, Ma'am.
    So far I've rolled into trouble all th' way, an' it looks
    like I'm still a-rollin'. I want to apologize for bustin'
    up your party�they've done faded."</p>

<p>"'Done faded' never was born in Montana," she
    retorted, suspicion glinting in her eyes. She lowered
    the gun until it rested on her knees, but its muzzle still
    covered Johnny.</p>

<p>"Neither was I, Ma'am," he replied, smiling. "I
    was born in Texas, an' grew up there. My greatest
    mistake was goin' north�but now I'm tryin' to wipe
    that out. It's a long trail. Ma'am; an' I've wasted a
    powerful lot of time."</p>

<p>"You shall waste some more; after that the speed
    of your departure will doubtless largely compensate
    you. How do I know you are telling the truth?"</p>

<p>"As to that, not meanin' no offense, I ain't none
    interested. An', Ma'am, neither are you. I might
    say, as a general proposition, that no stranger has any
    business askin' me personal questions; an', also, that
    in such cases I reserve th' right to lie as much as I
    please, 'though I ain't admittin' that I'm doin' it here.
    Pepper warned me that somethin' was wrong, which
    it was by several hundred yards�an', Ma'am, shootin'
    across a valley is shore deceivin'. Also I saw that one
    young lady was goin' to mix up serious with three
    growed-up men�pretty craggy individuals, from what
    I know of punchers. That was not th' right thing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4"
                                                                                 id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
    a lady to do�but I'm allus with th' under dog, I'm
    sorry to say, so I horned in an' offered you a gun that
    would fill them fellers with righteous indignation, homicidal
    yearnin's, an' a belief in miracles. I knowed they
    wouldn't get hurt at that distance�you see, there's
    little things like windage, trigger pull, an' others. But,
    Ma'am, th' sound of that lead an' th' noise of that gun
    shore would pester 'em. They'd get most amazin'
    curious, for men, an' look into it. An' when they found
    me with a gun on 'em they'd get more indignant than
    ever. Now, Ma'am, I've busted up yore party, which
    I had no right to do. If you wants them fellers right
    up close so you can look 'em over good an' ask 'em
    questions, say so, an' I'll go get 'em for you. I owe
    you that much. But I don't aim to be no party to a
    murder," he finished, smiling, and slowly and deliberately
    lowered his hands and rested them on his belt.</p>

<p>She was staring at him with blazing eyes, a look on
    her white face such as he never had seen on a woman
    before; and he realized that never before had he seen
    an angry woman. His smile changed subtly. It softened,
    the cynicism faded from it and kindly lines crept
    in; and there was something in his eyes that never had
    been there before. He looked out across the valley,
    at the few cows, where there should have been so many
    in a valley like that. Then he gazed steadily at the
    point where the three horsemen had become lost to
    sight�and the smile gave way to a look hard and
    cold. Pepper moved, and Johnny drew a deep breath,
    squaring his shoulders in sudden resolution. Swinging
    from the saddle he walked slowly forward toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
    threatening rifle muzzle, took the weapon from its
    owner's knees, lowered the hammer, and placed the
    gun against the rock at her side. Straightening up, he
    whistled softly. Pepper, advancing with mincing steps,
    shoved her velvety muzzle against his cheek and
    stopped. He swung into the saddle, wheeled the horse
    and rode around a near-by thicket, soon returning with
    a saddled SV pony, which he led to its owner. Mounting
    again, he backed Pepper away and, removing his
    sombrero, wheeled and sent the horse up the slope without
    a backward glance, sitting erect in the saddle as a
    figure of bronze until hidden by the crest and well down
    on the other side. Then he pulled suddenly at the reins
    with unthinking roughness and dashed at top speed to
    the left until the crest was again close at hand. With
    his head barely on a level with the top of the hill, he sat
    staring across the little valley at the point where the
    horsemen had disappeared; and there was a look on his
    face which, had they seen it, would have turned their
    conversation to subjects less trivial.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter">

    <h2 id="II">CHAPTER II</h2>

    <p class="center">BIT BY BIT</p></div>


<p class="p2">The sun was near the meridian when Johnny rode
    into Gunsight, a town which he took as a matter
    of course. They were all alike, he reflected. If it
    were not for the names they scarcely could be told apart�and
    it would have been just as well to have numbered
    them. A collection of shacks, with the over-played
    brave names. The shack he was riding for was
    the "Palace," which only rubbed it in. Out of a hundred
    towns, seventy-five would have their Palace saloon
    and fifty would have a Delmonico hotel. Dismounting
    before the door, he went in and saw the proprietor
    slowly arising from a chair, and he was the fattest man
    Johnny ever had seen. The visitor's unintentional
    stare started the conversation for him.</p>

<p>"Well, don't you like my looks?" bridled the proprietor.</p>

<p>Johnny's expression was one of injured innocence.
    "Why, I wasn't seein' you," he explained. "I was
    thinkin'�but now that you mention it, I don't see nothin'
    th' matter with your looks. Should there be?"</p>

<p>The other grunted something, becoming coherent
    only when the words concerned business. "What's
    yourn?"</p>

<p>"A drink with you, an' some information."</p>

<p>"Th' drink goes; but th' information don't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"I take it all back," soliloquized Johnny. "This
    town don't need a number; it don't even need a name.
    It's different. It's th' only one this side of Montanny
    where the barkeeper was hostile at th' start. I'm peaceful.
    My han's are up, palm out. If you won't give me
    information, will you tell me where I can eat an' sleep?
    Which of th' numerous hotels ain't as bad as th' rest
    of 'em?"</p>

<p>Davis Lee Beauregard Green slid a bottle across the
    bar, sent a glass spinning after it, leaned against the
    back bar and grinned. "Gunsight ain't impressin' you
    a hull lot?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"Why not? It's got all a man needs, which is why
    towns are made, ain't it?" Johnny tasted the liquor
    and downed it. "I allus size up a town by th' liquor it
    sells. I say Gunsight is a d�d sight better than I
    thought from a superficial examination."</p>

<p>Dave Green, wise in the psychology of the drinking
    type, decided that the stranger was not and never had
    been what he regarded as a drinking man; and even
    went so far in a quick, spontaneous flash of thought, as
    to tell himself that the stranger never had been drunk.
    Now, in his opinion, a hard-drinking, two-gun man was
    "bad;" but a coldly sober, real two-gun man was worse,
    although possibly less quarrelsome. He was certain
    that they lived longer. Dave was a good man with a
    short gun, despite his handicap; but a stirring warning
    instinct had told him that this stranger was the best
    who ever had entered his place. This impression
    came, was recognized, tabbed, and shoved back in his
    memory, all in a mechanical way. It was too plain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8"
                                                                                 id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
    be overlooked by a man who, perhaps without realizing
    it, studied humanity, although he could not lay a finger
    on a single thing and call it by name.</p>

<p>Dave put the bottle back and washed the glass.
    "Well," he remarked, "every man sizes things up
    accordin' to his own way of thinkin', which is why there
    are so many different opinions about th' same thing."
    Letting this ponderous nugget sink in, he continued:
    "I reckon th' bottom of it all is a man's wants. You
    want good liquor, so a town's good, or bad. Which is
    as good a way as any other, for it suits you. But,
    speakin' about eatin'-houses, there's a hotel just around
    th' corner. It's th' only one in town. It butts up agin'
    th' corner of my rear wall. Further than sayin' I've
    et there, I got no remarks to make. I cook my own,
    owin' to th' pressure of business, an' choice."</p>

<p>"It ain't run by no woman, is it?" asked Johnny.</p>

<p>"No; why?"</p>

<p>Johnny grinned. "I'm ridin' clear of wimmin. It
    was wimmin that sent me roamin' over th' face of th'
    earth, a wanderer. My friends all got married, an'�oh,
    well, I drifted. Th' first section I come to where
    there ain't none, I'll tie fast; an' this country looks like
    a snubbin' post, to me."</p>

<p>"You lose," chuckled Dave. "There's one down
    here, an' some folks think she's considerable. What's
    more, she's lookin' for a good man to run her dad's
    ranch, an' get an outfit together, as will stay put. But
    if you don't like 'em, that loses th' job for you. An'
    I reckon yo're right lucky at that."</p>

<p>"Shore; I know th' kind of a 'good' man they want,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
    said Johnny, reminiscently. "'Good,' meanin' habits
    only. A man that don't smoke, chew, drink, cuss, get
    mad, or keep his hat on in th' house. Losin' th' job
    ain't bendin' my shoulders. I ain't lookin' for work;
    I'm dodgin' it. Goin' to loaf till my money peters out,
    which won't be soon. You'd be surprised if you knowed
    how many people between here an' Montanny think
    they can play poker. Just now I'm a eddicator. I'm
    peddlin' knowledge to th' ignorant, an' I ain't no gambler,
    at that!"</p>

<p>Dave chuckled. "There's some around here, too.
    Now, me; I'm different. I can't play, an' I know it;
    but, of course, I'll set in, just for th' excitement of it,
    once in a while, if there ain't nothin' else to do. Come
    to think of it, I got a deck of cards around here
    some'rs, right now."</p>

<p>The rear door opened and closed. Johnny looked
    up and saw the worst-looking tramp of his experience.
    The newcomer picked up a sand-box cuspidor and
    started with it for the street.</p>

<p>"Hi, stranger!" called Johnny. "Ain't that dusty
    work?"</p>

<p>The tramp stiffened. He hardly could believe his
    ears. The tones which had assailed them were so spontaneously
    friendly that for a moment he was stunned.
    It had been a long time since he had been hailed like
    that�far too long a time. He turned his head slowly
    and looked and believed, for the grin which met his
    eyes was as sincere as the voice. It made him honest
    in his reply.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "this here's sand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"But ain't yore throat dusty?"</p>

<p>Two-Spot put the box down. "Seems like it allus is.
    If these boxes <i>get</i> dusty, I'll know how it come about,
    me bendin' over 'em like I do, an' breathin' on 'em."</p>

<p>Johnny laughed. "I take it we're all dusty." He
    turned to Dave. "Got three left?"</p>

<p>Two-Spot walked up to the bar. Usually he sidled.
    He picked up his glass and held it up to the light, and
    drank it in three swallows. Usually it was one gulp.
    Wiping his lips on a sleeve, he pushed back the glass,
    dug down into a pocket and brought up a silver dollar,
    which he tossed onto the bar. "Fill 'em again, Dave,"
    he said, quietly.</p>

<p>At this Dave's slowly accumulating wonder leaped.
    He looked at the coin and from it to Two-Spot. Sensing
    the situation, Johnny pushed it farther along towards
    the proprietor. "Our friend is right, Dave," he said,
    "two is company. Make mine th' same."</p>

<p>Two-Spot put down his empty glass and grinned.
    "I'll now go on from where I was interrupted, Gents,"
    and, picking up the box, went towards the door. As
    he was about to pass through he saw Pepper, and he
    stopped. "Good, Lord!" he muttered. "What a
    hoss! I've seen passels of hosses, but never one like
    that. Midnight her name oughter be, or Thunderbolt."
    He turned. "Stranger, what name do you call that
    hoss?"</p>

<p>Johnny looked around. "That's Pepper."</p>

<p>Two-Spot grinned. "Did you see that?" he demanded,
    tilting the box until the sand ran out. "Did
    you <i>see</i> it? She knows her name like a child. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11"
                                                                                      id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
    it's a good name�a fair name," he hedged. "But,
    shucks! There ain't <i>no</i> name fit for that hoss! How
    fur has she come today?"</p>

<p>"Near forty miles," answered Johnny.</p>

<p>"I say it ag'in�there ain't <i>no</i> name fit for that hoss.
    She looks like she come five," and he passed out.</p>

<p>"Don't mind him," said Dave. "But where did he
    git that dollar? Steal it? Find it? Reckon he found
    it. I near dropped dead. Pore devil�he come here
    last winter an' walks in, cleans my boxes an' sweeps.
    Then he goes 'round to th' hotel an' mops an' cleans th'
    pans better than they ever was before. He was so
    handy an' useful that we let him stay. An' I've never
    seen him more than half drunk�it's amazin' th' liquor
    he can hold."</p>

<p>"Sleep here?"</p>

<p>"No; an' nobody knows where he does sleep. He's
    cunnin' as a fox, an' fooled 'em every time. But wherever
    it is, it's dry."</p>

<p>Johnny produced a Sharp's single-shot cartridge.
    "Where can I get some of these Specials?" he
    asked.</p>

<p>Dave looked at it "'.45-120-550'�you won't get
    none of 'em down in this country."</p>

<p>"Post office in town?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. Th' nearest is Rawlins, thirty mile east,
    with th' worst trail a man ever rode. Th' next is Highbank,
    forty mile south. We use that, for th' trail's
    good. We get mail about twice a month. Th' Bar H
    an' th' Triangle take turns at it."</p>

<p>"Then I'll write for some of these after I feed. I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12"
                                                                                 id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
    tell 'em to send 'em to you, at Highbank. What name
    will I give?"</p>

<p>"Dave Green, Highbank-Gunsight mail. But you
    better write before you eat. This is goin' away day,
    an' th' Bar H will be in any minute now."</p>

<p>Johnny arose. "Not before I eat. I ain't had
    nothin' since daybreak, an' it's afternoon now. I hate
    letter writin'; an' if I don't eat soon I'll get thin."</p>

<p>"Then don't eat�'though I wasn't thinkin' of you
    when I spoke," growled Dave. "Wish I was in danger
    of gettin' thin."</p>

<p>"What you care?" demanded Johnny. "Yo're
    healthy, an' yore job don't call for a man bein' light."</p>

<p>"That's th' way you fellers talk," said Dave. "I'm
    short-winded, I'm in my own way, an' the joke of th'
    country. I can't ride a hoss�why, cuss it, I can't even
    get a gun out quick enough to get a hop-toad before he's
    moved twenty feet!"</p>

<p>"Pullin' a gun has its advantages, I admits," replied
    Johnny, who had his own ideas about Dave's ability in
    that line. Dave, he thought, could get a gun out quick
    enough for the average need�being a bartender, and
    still alive, was proof enough of that. He walked toward
    the door. "If you was to get a big hoss�a
    single-footer, you could ride, all right."</p>
