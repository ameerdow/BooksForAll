<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p class="tp"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N this Edition of "<span class="smcap">Songs of the West</span>," some
    considerable
    changes have been made. When the first edition was issued, we had to
    catch the public taste, and to humour it. Accordingly the choruses
    were arranged in four parts, and some of the Songs were set as duets
    and quartettes. But now that real interest in Folk airs has been
    awakened, we have discarded this feature.</p>

<p>Moreover, a good many accompanists complained that the arrangements
    were too elaborate, except for very skilled pianoforte players. We
    have now simplified the settings.</p>

<p>Then, we have omitted twenty-two songs, and have supplied their
    places with others, either because the others are intrinsically
    better, or that they have earlier and more characteristic melodies,
    or again because the songs though sung by the people, did not seem to
    us to have been productions of the folk-muse.</p>

<p>Again, when our first edition was published, modal melodies were not
    appreciated, and we had regretfully to put many aside and introduce
    more of the airs of a modern character. Public taste is a little
    healthier now, and musicians have multiplied who can value these
    early melodies. Consequently we have not felt the same reserve now
    that we did in 1889.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p class="tp"><span class="dropcap">D</span>OROTHY OSBORNE, in a letter to Sir William Temple, in 1653, thus
    describes her daily home life. "The heat of the day is spent in
    reading or working, and about six or seven o'clock I walk out into
    a common that lies hard by the house, where a great many young
    wenches keep sheep or cows, and sit in the shade singing ballads.
    I go to them and compare their voices and beauties to some ancient
    shepherdesses that I have read of, and find a vast difference there;
    but trust me these are as innocent as those could be. I talk to them,
    and find they want nothing to make them the happiest people in the
    world but the knowledge that they are so. Most commonly, when we are
    in the midst of our discourse, one looks about her, and spies her
    cows going into the corn, and then away they all run as if they had
    wings to their heels." ("Letters of Dorothy Osborne," London, 1888,
    p. 103.)</p>

<p>Before that Sir Thomas Overbury, in his "Character of a Milkmaid,"
    had written: "She dares go alone and unfold her sheep in the night,
    and fears no manner of ill, because she means none: yet, to say
    truth, she is never alone, she is still accompanied with old songs,
    honest thoughts, and prayers, but short ones."</p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Mary, the Princess Elizabeth was kept
    under close guard and restraint, but was suffered to walk in the
    palace grounds. "In this situation," says Holinshed, "no marvel if
    she, hearing upon a time, out of her garden at Woodstock, a certain
    milkmaid singing pleasantlie, wished herself to be a milkmaid as she
    was; saying that her case was better, and life merrier." So Viola, in
    Fletcher's play, "The Coxcombe," 1647:</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p><span class="i4">"Would to God, my father</span><br>
            Had lived like one of these, and bred me up<br>
            To milk, and do as they do! Methinks 'tis<br>
            A life that I would chuse, if I were now<br>
            To tell my time again, above a prince's."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The milkmaid, and the girls guarding sheep and cows are things of
    the past, and with them have largely departed their old ballads and
    songs. Tusser, in his "Points on Huswifry," in 1570, recommends the
    country housewife to select her maids from those who sing at their
    work as being usually the most painstaking and the best.</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Such servants are oftenest painsfull and good,<br>
            That sing at their labours, like birds in a wood."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Nowadays, domestic servants sing nothing but hymns, and the use of
    ballads and folksongs has died out among farm girls, and these are
    to be recovered only where there are village industries as basket
    weaving, glove sewing, and the like.</p>

<p>But the old men sing their ancient ditties, or did so till within
    the last fifty years. Now they are no longer called on for them, but
    they remember them, and with a little persuasion can be induced to
    render them up. When I was a boy, I was wont to ride over and about
    Dartmoor, and to put up at little village taverns. There I was sure
    in the evening to hear one or two men sing, and should it be a pay
    day, sing hour after hour, one song following another with little
    intermission.</p>

<p>There was an institution at mines and quarries called a <i>fetching</i>.
    It occurred every fortnight. The men left work early, and went to
    the changing room; stone jars of ale were brought thither from the
    nearest public house. Each man filled his mug, and each in turn,
    before emptying it, was required to sing. On such occasions many a
    fine old ballad was to be picked up. There was also the farm-supper
    after harvest, at which the workmen sang. Now the suppers have been
    discontinued. Ringer's feasts, happily, still remain, and at them a
    good old ditty may be heard. But most of the old singers with their
    traditional ballads set to ancient modal melodies have passed away.</p>

<p>In "Poems, etc.," by Henry Incledon Johns, published by subscription,
    Devonport, 1832, is the following interesting passage. He is
    describing a night spent in an inn on the borders of Dartmoor; he
    met farmers and labourers. "One of the party I observed never took
    any share in the conversation, but appeared to have been invited
    there for the sole purpose of singing to them. He sang a great number
    of ballads, making up in loudness for what he lacked in melody. I
    thought it betrayed rather a want of courtesy that his auditors
    continued to talk while he sang, and no less remarkable, that they
    never expressed either applause or disapprobation of his strains.
    Now and then, one or two of them would join in a line of chorus, but
    it seemed to be done in a sort of parenthesis, and the thread of the
    conversation was immediately resumed as vehemently as ever.... I
    gleaned the following scraps of the border minstrelsy of Dartmoor:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">-vii-</a></span></p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>'There was an old man as blind as blind could be,<br>
            He swore he saw the fox go up a great tree.'</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>'There was one among them all<br>
            That's slender, fair and tall,<br>
            With a black and rolling eye,<br>
            And a skin of lily dye.'</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>'A bonny lass I courted full many a long day,<br>
            And dearly I loved to be in her sweet company.'</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>(The lover then describes the progress of his suit, which proves
    unsuccessful, and concludes thus:ï¿½)</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>'Go, dig me a pit, that is long, large, and deep,<br>
            And I'll lay myself down, and take a long sleep.<br>
            <span class="i5">And that's the way to forget her.'</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>"The air to the latter was rather plaintive, and from the lips of
    some siren might have been entitled to an <i>encore</i>, but the voice
    which now gave it utterance only added another to many previous
    proofs that the English are not a musical people. The minstrel was
    in appearance one of the most athletic men I have ever seen, and
    although seventy-five years of age, would still, as I subsequently
    learnt, perform a day's work better than most of the young men of the
    parish. He was a pauper, but in great respect among the neighbouring
    rustics for his vocal powers. His auditory were moor-farmers with
    countenances as rugged and weather-beaten as the rocks among which
    they live."</p>

<p>It is not a little interesting to know that some seventy years after
    this recorded evening we were able to recover two of the songs which
    Mr. Johns gives somewhat inaccurately; and both are included in this
    collection. The first is "<a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_75_THREE_JOVIAL_WELSHMEN">The Three
        Jovial Welshmen</a>," No. 75; and the
    last is "<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_97_THE_FALSE_BRIDE">The False
        Bride</a>," No. 97.</p>

<p>One of my old singers, James Olver, was the son of very strict
    Wesleyans. When he was a boy, he was allowed to hear no music save
    psalm and hymn tunes. But he was wont to creep out of his window at
    night, and start away to the tavern where the miners congregated,
    and listen to and heap up in his memory the songs he there heard. As
    these were forbidden fruit they were all the more dearly prized and
    surely remembered, and when he was a white-haired old man, he poured
    them out to us.</p>

<p>Some forty or fifty years ago, it was customary when the corn was
    cut, for the young men of a parish to agree together, and without
    telling the farmer of their intention, to invade his harvest field,
    work all night and stack his corn, whilst he slept. It was allowed
    to leak out who had done him this favour, and in return, he invited
    them with their lasses to sup and dance and make merry in a lighted
    barn. Then famous old songs were sung. But all that good feeling is
    at an end, and in its place exists a rankling hostility between the
    tiller of the soil and his employer. Blame assuredly attaches to the
    farmer for this condition of affairs, in that he has done away with
    the farmhouse festivities in which workmen and employer took part.</p>

<p>One evening in 1888, I was dining with the late Mr. Daniel Radford,
    of Mount Tavy, when the conversation turned to old Devonshire songs.
    Some of those present knew "<a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_16_WIDDECOMBE_FAIR">Widdecombe Fair</a>,"
    others remembered
    "<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_2_THE_HUNTING_OF_ARSCOTT_OF_TETCOTT">Arscott
        of Tetcott</a>"; and all had heard many and various songs sung
    at Hunt-suppers, at harvest and sheep-shearing feasts. My host turned
    to me and said: "It is a sad thing that our folk-music should perish.
    I wish you would set to work and collect itï¿½gather up the fragments
    that remain before all is lost!"</p>

<p>I undertook the task. I found that it was of little use going to most
    farmers and yeoman. They sang the compositions of Hooke, Hudson, and
    Dibden. But I learned that there were two notable old singing men
    at South Brent, and I was aware that there was one moorland singing
    farmer at Belstone, I was informed of this by J.D. Prickman, Esq., of
    Okehampton. This man, Harry Westaway, knew many old songs. Moreover,
    in my own neighbourhood was a totally illiterate hedger, in fact, he
    could neither read nor write. He enjoyed no little local celebrity
    as a song-man. His name was James Parsons, aged seventy-four, and
    a son of a still more famous singer called "The Singing-machine,"
    and grandson of another of the same fame. In fact, the profession
    of song-man was hereditary in the family. At every country
    entertainment, in olden times, at the public-house almost nightly,
    for more than a century, one of these men of the Parsons' family had
    not failed to attend, to sing as required for the entertainment of
    the company. The <i>repertoire</i> of the grandfather had descended to
    old James. For how many generations before him the profession had
    been followed I could not learn. James Parsons' ballad tunes were
    of an early and archaic character. In fact, with few exceptions his
    melodies were in the Gregorian modes. At one time Parsons and a man
    named Voysey were working on the fringe of Dartmoor, and met in
    the evening at the moorland tavern.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">-viii-</a></span>
    Parsons boasted of the number
    of songs he knew, and Voysey promised to give him a glass of ale
    for every fresh one he sang. Parsons started with "The Outlandish
    Knight," one song streamed forth after another, one glass after
    another was emptied, and these men sat up the whole night, till
    the sun rose, and the song-man's store was not then exhausted, but
    Voysey's pocket was. I could hardly credit this tale when told me, so
    I questioned Voysey, who had worked for my father and was working for
    me. He laughed and confirmed the tale. "I ought to remember it," he
    said, "for he cleared me clean out."</p>

<p>Many a pleasant evening have I spent with old Parsons, he in the
    settle, sitting over the hall fire, I taking down the words of his
    ballads, Mr. Sheppard or Mr. Bussell noting down his melodies.</p>

<p>But one day I heard that an accident had befallen Parsons. In cutting
    "spears," <i>i.e.</i>, pegs for thatching, on his knee he had cut into the
    joint; and the village doctor told me he feared Parsons at his age
    would never get over it. I sent for Mr. Bussell, and said to him: "We
    shall lose our old singer, before we have quite drained him. Come
    with me, and we will visit his cottage, and see what more we can get
    from him." We went, and very pleased he was to sing to us from his
    bed. "<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_30_OLD_WICHET">Old Wichet</a>," No. 30,
    was one of the songs we then acquired from
    him. Happily, the sturdy constitution of the man caused his recovery,
    and he lived on for three years after this accident.</p>

<p>One day in November, I got a letter from the Vicar of South Brent,
    in which he informed me that Robert Hard, a crippled stone-breaker
    there, and one of my song-men, was growing very feeble. Without delay
    I took the train, and arrived at South Brent Vicarage, just as the
    party had finished breakfast. "Now," said I to the Vicar, "Lend me
    your drawing room and the piano, and send for old Hard."</p>

<p>The stone breaker arrived, and I spent almost the whole day, that is,
    till the dusk of evening fell, taking down his songs and melodies.
    From him then, I had "The Cuckoo," that I have published in my
    "Garland of Country Songs." A month later, poor old Hard was found
    dead in a snowdrift by the roadside.</p>

<p>I had enlisted the services of such excellent musicians as the late
    Rev. H. Fleetwood Sheppard, of Thurnscoe, Yorkshire, and Mr., now
    the Rev. Doctor Bussell, Mus. Doc., and Vice-principal of <span class="err" title="Brasenose">Brazennose</span>
    College, Oxford, and we worked at
    collecting, at South Brent, where besides Robert Hard, was John
    Helmore, a miller, who died in the Ivy Bridge Workhouse in 1900;
    also at Belstone, and we worked through the length and breadth of
    Dartmoor. James Coaker,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> a
    blind man of 89, in the heart of the
    moor, very infirm, and able to leave his bed for a few hours of the
    day only, was unable to sing, but could recite the words of ballads;
    but Mr. J. Webb, captain of a mine hard by, knew his tunes, and could
    very sweetly pipe them. On Blackdown, Mary Tavy, lived a mason,
    Samuel Fone, he died in 1898. He had an almost inexhaustible supply.
    Further songs were yielded by a singing blacksmith, John Woodrich, of
    Woolacott Moor, Thrushleton, commonly known as "Ginger Jack"; also
    by Roger Luxton, of Halwell, by James Olver, Tanner, Launceston, a
    native of S. Kewe, Cornwall; by John Masters, of Bradstone, aged
    83; by William Rice and John Rickards, both of Lamerton; by William
    Friend, labourer, Lydford; Edmund Fry, thatcher, a native of Lezant,
    Cornwall; Roger Hannaford, Widdecombe; Will and Roger Huggins,
    Lydford; W. Bickle, Bridestowe; Matthew Baker, a poor cripple, Lew
    Down; John Dingle, Coryton; J. Peake, tanner, Liskeard; and Mr. S.
    Gilbert, the aged innkeeper of the "Falcon," Mawgan, in Pyder. More
    were obtained from old singers at Two Bridges and Post Bridge on
    Dartmoor, from others at Chagford, at Holne, and at South Brent. From
    others again at Menheniot, Cornwall, and at Fowey. Some songs taken
    down from moor men on Dartmoor, in or about 1868, were sent me by
    W. Crossing, Esq., who knows Dartmoor better than any man living;
    others by T.S. Cayzer, Esq., taken down in 1849. Miss Bidder, of
    Stoke Flemming, most kindly searched her neighbourhood for old women
    who knew ancient songs, and sent me what she obtained. We had several
    rare old melodies from Sally Satterley,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> now
    dead, of Huccaby
    Bridge, Dartmoor. She had acquired them from her father, a crippled
    fiddler.</p>

<p>Of the vast quantities of tunes that we have collected, perhaps a
    third are very good, a third are good, and the remainder indifferent.
    The singers are almost invariably illiterate and aged, and when they
    die the tradition will be lost, for the present generation will
    have nothing to do with these songs, especially such as are modal,
    and supplant them with the vulgarest music hall compositions. The
    melodies are far more precious than the words, and we have been
    more concerned to rescue these than the words, which are often
    common-place, and may frequently be found on broadside ballad sheets.
    The words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">-ix-</a></span> are less frequently of home growth
    than the airs, and over
    and over again we came upon ballads already in print, but not to the
    tunes to which they are sung elsewhere. There are, in fact, only a
    few, such as "Cupid's Garden," "Bold General Wolf," "Lord Thomas and
    the Fair Eleanor," "Barbara Allen," "Outward Bound," "The Mermaid,"
    that retain the melodies to which sung in other parts of England.
    But, "<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_95_TOBACCO_IS_AN_INDIAN_WEED">Tobacco is
        an Indian Weed</a>," "Joans' Ale is New," "<a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_55_THE_FOX">The Fox</a>," and
    many others have tunes to which sung in Devon and Cornwall that are
    quite different and local. A remarkable instance is that of "<a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_15_SWEET_NIGHTINGALE">Sweet
        Nightingale</a>." This appeared in 1761 with music by Dr. Arne. The words
    travelled down to Cornwall, not so Arne's tune, and they were there
    set to an entirely independent melody. Then again, when a tune did
    travel West, and was heard by some of the peasant singers, if it did
    not commend itself to their taste, they altered it, perhaps quite
    unconsciously into a form more satisfactory to their minds. I have
    given a very curious example of this, "<a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_3_UPON_A_SUNDAY_MORNING">Upon a Sunday
        Morning</a>."</p>

<p>Our folk music is a veritable moraine of rolled and ground fragments
    from musical strata far away. It contains melodies of all centuries
    from the days of the minstrels down to the present time, all thrown
    together in one heap. It must be borne well in mind that to the
    rustic singer, melody is everything. It was so in the days before
    Elizabeth. The people then did not want harmony; to them harmony is
    quite a modern invention and need.</p>

<p>At the present day, we are so accustomed to choral and concerted
    music that we have come to care little for formal melody, and Wagner
    has taught us to be content with musical phrases alone. Melody is
    a musical idea worked out in successive notes of our scale. Modern
    music is constructed in but two of the seven diatonic modes, in which
    melodies may be cast, the major and the minor; with the result that
    the modern ear entertains no appreciation of an air that is not in
    the Ionian scale, the "tonus lascivus" of the ancients.</p>

<p>The jongleur or minstrel had but the rudest of instruments; the
    peasant singer had none at all. What interest he can create, what
    effect he can produce, must be through melody alone. Now, I venture
    to assert that the folk music of the English peasantry has been
    surpassingly rich in melodiousness, and that no tune has had a chance
    of living and being transmitted from generation to generation,
    unless it have a distinct individuality in it, in a word, contains
    a melodious idea. Moreover, not having been framed only in the
    common major or minor key, it is abundantly varied. It has been a
    well-spring from which hitherto we have not drawn.</p>

<p>In former times, that strongly defined dividing line which separates
    the cultured from the uncultured did not exist. The music of
    the peasant was also the music of the court; the ballad was the
    delight of the cottager and of the noble lady in her bower. But the
    separation began, in music, in the Elizabethan days; in ballads,
    in those of James I., when nearly every old ballad was re-written
    to fresh metres, unsingable to the traditional airs. The skilled
    musician scorned folk melodies, and revelled in counter-point.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that all mediï¿½val music was in the
    Gregorian modes other than our major and minor. Even in the 13th
    century, the modern major mode was used, so that some of our
    traditional airs, which seem to be modern may really be old.</p>

<p>M. Tiersot notes that among the melodies extant of three trouvï¿½res of
    the Thirteenth century, a certain number are modern in character. Of
    twenty-two airs by the Chatelain de Coucy, three are frankly in the
    major; five others in the 7th or the 8th tone, give the impression of
    the major. Of nine melodies by the King of Navarre, four are in the
    major, a fifth in the 7th tone, is of the same nature as those of De
    Coucy. Of thirty-four <i>chansons</i> by Adam de la Hall, twenty-one are
    in the major.</p>

<p>The folk airs that we give in our collection may not please at
    first, certainly will not please all; but when once a relish for
    them has been acquired, then hearers will turn with weariness from
    the ordinary concert hall feebleness, as we turn from the twaddle of
    a vacuous female. We have found it necessary to take down all the
    variants of the same air that we have come across.</p>

<p>M. Bourgault Ducoudray, in his introduction to "Mï¿½lodies populaires
    de Basse Bretagne," Paris, 1885, says: "When a song has been
    transmitted from mouth to mouth, without having been fixed by
    notation, it is exposed to alterations. One is sometimes obliged to
    collect as many as twenty variants of the same air, before finding
    one that is good. This is the greatest difficulty to the seeker; it
    is as hard to lay the hand on the veritable typal form of a melody
    as it is to meet with an intact specimen among the shells that have
    been rolled on the sea shore." When a party of singers is assembled,
    or when one man sings a succession of ballads, the memory becomes
    troubled; the first few melodies are given correctly, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">-x-</a></span>
    after
    that, the airs become deflected and influenced by the airs last sung.
    At Two Bridges one old singer, G. Kerswell, after giving us "The
    Bell-ringers," sang us half-a-dozen ballads but the melody of the
    bells went through them all, and vitiated them all so as to render
    them worthless. On another occasion, we took down four or five airs
    all beginning alike, because one singer had impressed this beginning
    on the minds of the others. At another time, when this impression was
    worn off, they would sing correctly, and then the beginnings would be
    different. Experience taught us never to take down too much at one
    sitting.</p>

<p>In a very few years all this heritage of traditional folk music will
    be gone; and this is the supreme moment at which such a collection
    can be made. Already, nearly every one of my old singers from
    whom these melodies were gathered, is dead. They are passing away
    everywhere. Few counties of England have been worked. Sussex has
    been well explored by the late Rev. John Broadwood, and then by Miss
    Lucy Broadwood<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>;
    Yorkshire, by Mr. Frank Kidson; Northumberland,
    by Dr. Collingwood Bruce and Mr. John Stokoe. Mr. Cecil Sharp is now
    engaged on Somersetshire, and Dr. Vaughan Williams on Essex. Who will
    undertake Lincolnshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and other counties? The
    purely agricultural districts are most auriferous. In manufacturing
    counties modern music has driven out the traditional folk melodies.</p>

<p>With regard to the approximate dates of the airs we give, all that
    we can say is that such as are in the ancient modes are not later
    than the reign of James I. How much more ancient they may be, it is
    impossible to determine. The melodies of the Handel and Arne, and
    then those of the Hooke and Dibden periods can be at once detected.
    Some few of the melodies we have taken down were certainly originally
    in one or other of the ancient modes, but in process of time have
    been subjected to alteration, to accommodate them to the modern ear.</p>

<p>Although some seventy per cent. of the airs noted from the very
    old singers are modal, we have not given too many of these, as the
    popular taste is not sufficiently educated to relish them. But such
    as can not perceive the beauty of the tunes that go, for instance,
    to "<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_4_THE_TREES_THEY_ARE_SO_HIGH">The Trees
        they are so high</a>," in the rarely used Phrygian mode,
    "<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_58_FLORA_THE_LILY_OF_THE_WEST">Flora, the
        Flower of the West</a>," in F, "<a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_53_HENRY_MARTYN">Henry Martyn</a>," "<a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_73_ON_A_MAY_MORNING_SO_EARLY">On a May
        morning so early</a>," etc., are indeed to be pitied. We have not been
    able to give those lengthy ballads, such as, "The Outlandish Knight,"
    "The Brown Girl," "By the Banks of Green Willow," "The Baffled
    Knight," "William and the Shepherd's Daughter," "Captain Ward," "The
    Golden Glove," "The Maid and the Box," "The Death of Queen Jane,"
    etc., which are too long to be sung and listened to with patience
    now-a-days.</p>

<p>In some instances we have set other words to a ballad tune, as <a
        href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_36_A_SWEET_PRETTY_MAIDEN_SAT_UNDER_A_TREE">XXXVI</a>.
    One of my old singers said to me concerning this ballad, "When my
    little sister, now dead, these twenty years, was a child, and went up
    from Exeter to London with me in a carrier's van, Lor bless'y, afore
    railways was invented, I mind that she sang this here ballet in the
    waggon all the way up. We was three days about it. She was then about
    six years old." The ballet, by the way, is not particularly choice
    and suitable for a child or a grown-up girl to sing, according to our
    ideas.</p>

<p>In giving these songs to the public, we have been scrupulous to
    publish the airs precisely as noted down, choosing among the
    variants those which commended themselves to us as the soundest.
    But we have not been so careful with regard to the <i>words</i>. These
    are sometimes in a fragmentary condition, or are coarse, contain
    <i>double entendres</i>, or else are mere doggerel. Accordingly, we have
    re-written the songs wherever it was not possible to present them
    in their original form. This was done by the Scotch. Many an old
    ballad is gross, and many a broadside is common-place. Songs that
    were thought witty in the Caroline and early Georgian epochs, are no
    longer sufferable; and broadside ballads are in many cases vulgarised
    versions of earlier ballads that have been lost in their original
    forms.</p>

<p>What a change has taken place in public feeling with regard to
    decency may be judged by the way in which Addison speaks of D'Urfey
    in "The Guardian," 1713, No. 29. "A <i>judicious</i> author, some years
    since, published a collection of sonnets, which he very successfully
    called "Laugh and be Fat; or, Pills to purge Melancholy." I can
    not sufficiently admire the facetious title of these volumes, and
    must censure the world of ingratitude, while they are so negligent
    in rewarding the jocose labours of my friend, Mr. D'Urfey, who was
    so large a contributor to this treatise, and to whose numerous
    productions so many rural squires in the remotest parts of the
    island are obliged for the dignity and state which corpulency gives
    them." And again, in No. 67, "I must heartily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">-xi-</a></span>
    recommend to all
    young ladies, my disciples, the case of my old friend, who has often
    made their grand-mothers merry, and whose sonnets have perhaps
    lulled to sleep many a present toast, when she lay in her cradle."
    Whyï¿½D'Urfey's Pills must now-a-days be kept under lock and key. The
    fun so commended by the pious and grave Addison is filth of the most
    revolting description. And yet the grand-mothers of the ladies of his
    day, according to him, were wont to sing them over the cradles of
    their grand-children!</p>

<p>So when a "Collection of Old Ballads" was published 1723-5, the
    Editor, after giving a series of historical and serious pieces, in
    a later volume apologises to the ladies for their gravity, and for
    their special delectation furnishes an appendix of songs that are
    simply dirty.</p>

<p>A good many of the ditties in favour with our rural song-men, are,
    it must be admitted, of the D'Urfey type; and what is more some of
    the very worst are sung to the daintiest early melodies. Two courses
    lay open to us. One that adopted Dr. Barrett and Mr. Kidson to print
    the words exactly as given on the broadsides, with asterisks for the
    undesirable stanzas. But this would simply have killed the songs.
    No one would care to warble what was fragmentary. On the other
    hand, there is that adopted by the Scotch and Irish collectors,
    which consists in re-writing or modifying where objectionable or
    common-place. This has been the course we have pursued. It seemed a
    pity to consign the lovely old melodies to the antiquary's library,
    by publishing them with words which were fatal to the success of the
    songs in the drawing room or the concert hall. We resolved where the
    old words were good, or tolerable, to retain them. Where bad, to
    re-write, adhering as closely as possible to the original. Where the
    songs were mere broadside ballads, we have had no scruple in doing
    this, for we give reference to the press-mark in the British Museum,
    where the original text may be found. But the broadside itself is
    often a debased form of a fine early ballad. The broadside publishers
    were wont to pay a shilling to any ballad mongers who could furnish
    them with a new ditty. These men were destitute of the poetic faculty
    and illiterate, and they contented themselves with taking old ballads
    and recomposing them, so as to give to them a semblance of novelty,
    sufficient to qualify their authors to claim the usual fee. Here are
    some lines by one of the fraternity:</p>
