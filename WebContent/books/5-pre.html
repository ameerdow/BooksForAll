<p class="dropcap">Leaving the Colophon in its bibliographical
    aspects to the able hand by
    which these are about to be treated, it
    may not be amiss to preface Mr. Pollard’s
    researches by a brief inquiry into
    the origin and significance of the term itself, and the
    reason why the colophon for so long performed the
    office of the title-page.</p>

<p><i>Colophon</i> originally meant the head or summit of anything.
    It is clearly cognate with κορυφή, but is a word
    of far less importance, for while thirteen derivatives
    from κορυφή are given in Liddell and Scott’s Dictionary,
    κολοφών has not one. The former word is continually
    used by Homer; the latter is first met with in Plato, and
    then and afterwards only in a figurative sense. Yet it is
    clear that the word must from the first have borne the

    of the city of Colophon, which must have derived
    its name from its elevation, just as a modern house may
    be called “Hilltop.” Names of this kind, if not given at
    the first, are rarely given at all; we must suppose, then,
    that <i>colophon</i> was a recognized Greek word for “summit”
    when the city was founded about the tenth century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>,
    according to Strabo by a Pylian colony, though this
    seems difficult to reconcile with the fact of Colophon
    being an Ionian city. In any case, the word has long survived
    the place.</p>

<p>According to the information supplied by the New
    English Dictionary, <i>colophon</i> made a brief appearance in
    English, in the first half of the seventeenth century, in
    its secondary classical sense of a “finishing stroke” or
    “crowning touch,” being used thus in Burton’s “Anatomy
    of Melancholy,” and again in 1635 by John Swan,
    who writes in his “Speculum Mundi” of how God “comes
    to the Creation of Man and makes him the colophon or
    conclusion of all things else.” Of the use of the word
    <i>colophon</i> in the particular significance elucidated in this
    essay—the end or ultimate paragraph of a book or manuscript—the
    earliest example quoted in the New English
    Dictionary is from Warton’s “History of English Poetry,”
    published in 1774. A quarter of a century before this it
    is found as a term needing no explanation in the first
    edition of the “Typographical Antiquities” of Joseph
    Ames, published in 1749. How much older it is than
    this cannot lightly be determined. The bibliographical
    use appears to be unknown to the Greek and Latin lexicographers,
    medieval as well as classical. Pending further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
    investigation, it seems not unlikely that it may have
    been developed out of the secondary classical sense already
    mentioned sometime during the seventeenth century,
    when the interest in bibliography which was then
    beginning to be felt would naturally call into existence
    new terms of art. The Latin word <i>subscriptio</i>, which is
    used in a not very dissimilar sense, could hardly have
    been modernized without ambiguity. The Greek κορωνις,
    used for a flourish at the end of a manuscript, had not
    entered into any modern language. It is possible that it
    was thus only at a comparatively late date that a need was
    felt for a special word to denote the final paragraph of a
    book, and that the metaphorical use of <i>colophon</i> for a
    “finishing touch” caused it to be specialized in this sense.
    But whenever this use of the word <i>colophon</i> may have
    arisen, it is manifest that if this paragraph is to convey any
    description of the book, it fulfils the office of a title-page;
    and when we examine the manner in which <i>colophon</i>
    came to bear this special connotation, we shall see that
    the printer’s colophon could not, except for a very short
    period while men’s ideas were still indefinite, have coexisted
    with the title-page.</p>

<p>The idea especially implied in the Greek proverbial
    phrase “to put on the colophon” is that of putting the
    finishing stroke to anything, as when a building is completed
    by the addition of the coping-stone, or a discourse
    is summed up by a recapitulation of its general gist. Is
    the word simply used in the sense of a crowning peak?
    or has it a special connection with the city of Colophon?
    Ancient writers assert the latter, and assign two reasons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
    one of which at least seems fanciful. Strabo says that the
    allusion is to the decisive charges of the Colophonian
    cavalry, which were made at the last moment. There
    seems no other indication of Colophon having possessed
    a high military reputation. The Scholiast on the “Theaetetus”
    of Plato gives a more probable derivation; he says
    that, on account of their having received the Smyrnaeans
    into their city, the people of Colophon were allowed a
    casting-vote in the Panionium, or congress of the twelve
    Ionian cities, and hence the expression was equivalent
    to “turn the scale.” There would be nothing unreasonable
    in this supposition if we were sure that the Colophonians
    actually had this casting-vote; but the notion may
    well have been invented to explain the proverb; and,
    after all, if κολοφών has the sense of “crest,” no historical
    explanation seems necessary.</p>

<p>We have, however, solely to consider here the application
    of the term <i>colophon</i> to books, and must ask,
    What portion of a book would embody that final touch
    which we have seen to be essential to the idea of a colophon?
    In modern times we should probably say the imprint,
    for although the printer’s name, as well as the publisher’s,
    may be given at the bottom or on the reverse of
    the title-page, it is more usual to find it at the end. The
    ancient colophon also gave this information, but it commonly
    gave much more. To understand the part it played
    in early printing, we must go back to its predecessor, the
    manuscript.</p>

<p>Manuscripts, as the parents of printed books, have necessarily
    exercised the greatest influence on their development.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
    A step which might have been very important
    was taken when, probably early in the fifth century, the
    form most convenient for the printed book was established
    by the definitive supersession of the roll form of
    manuscript by the <i>codex</i>, or manuscript in modern book
    form. Codices are of sufficient antiquity to be figured in
    the paintings at Pompeii, but the derivation from <i>caudices</i>,
    thin leaves of wood, shows that they were not at first
    much used for literary purposes, but rather for accounts
    or memoranda. When they began to compete with the
    roll, a step in the direction of convenience which may be
    appreciated by us if we can imagine that all our books had
    at one time been printed in newspaper form, we find the
    colophon already installed under the title of <i>index</i>. This
    did not denote the key to the contents of a book, thought
    so indispensable in modern times, but to the title, giving
    generally the subject and author of the book with the utmost
    brevity, and written at the end, precisely like a colophon,
    which in fact it was, though not bearing the name.
    As the papyrus roll was not bound, there could be no lettering
    upon a cover unless when, as was sometimes the
    case, a fine manuscript was inclosed within a case or wrappage
    for its protection; and the inconvenience of having
    to open every roll to find the title soon suggested the idea
    of hanging the index outside the roll on a separate slip,
    brightly dyed so as to attract attention. Examples may
    be seen in paintings from Pompeii. The general, though
    as yet by no means universal, displacement of papyrus by
    parchment led to the introduction of binding, early in the
    fifth century, as the best method of preserving codices. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
    had, of course, been practised before, but could not make
    much progress while the majority of books were papyrus
    scrolls; and even in the case of codices it seems to have
    been chiefly employed for the opportunity it afforded of
    adorning a valued manuscript with a splendid exterior.
    The disuse of the roll, however, soon made binding
    universal. In the Customs of the Augustinian priory at
    Barnwell it is distinctly laid down: “As the books ought
    to be mended, printed, and taken care of by the Librarian,
    so ought they to be properly bound by him.”</p>
