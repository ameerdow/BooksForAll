<h2 id="NOTE_BY_THE_PUBLISHER"><i>NOTE BY THE PUBLISHER</i></h2>
</div>

<p><i>The story of a great life-saving social revolution,
the mightiest in the nineteenth century and one
of the most momentous in the history of civilization,
is told here for the first time. It is told from the
standpoint of the transformation of the City of New
York, by a chief actor in the event.</i></p>

<p><i>Only by forcing ourselves into a receptive mood
can we of the present credit the half of what is set
before us concerning The City That Was. The
shocked imagination rebels. It seeks relief in assuming
that even a trained expert, a contemporaneous
witness and investigator of the conditions described,
in writing after they have passed away, unconsciously
yields to the historian’s temptation to throw the past
into dramatic relief by starting exaggerations.</i></p>

<p><i>Dr. Smith, however, leaves us no room for doubt.
The appalling chapter in which he lays bare the New
York of 1864 is a contemporaneous document. It is a
physician’s report of a systematic medical inspection
of New York in that year, as delivered before a Legislative
Committee a few months later by the very physician
who had directed the inspection.</i></p>

<p><i>Nevertheless, The City That Was is not New York
alone. She is but a type. Her condition, with variations,
may be multiplied, during the early years of
the nineteenth century, by the total of the cities,
towns, and villages in the world. In the work of
regeneration some of these anticipated her. Others,
including all throughout the territory of the United
States, were aroused through her agitation and inspired
by her example.</i></p>

<p><i>As a student of local history, the writer thought
himself familiar with the many phases of the growth
of New York; but the condition of the City as late
as the period of our Civil War, as here depicted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
startled him as might a revelation. He believes that
no seriously minded man or woman can afford to
ignore this volume. We owe it to ourselves and to
one another fully to face its lesson.</i></p>

<p><i>We shall be shocked; we shall be filled with horror;
but accepting the city that now is, great as her faults
may be, with a new gratitude, we shall turn with
anointed sympathy and understanding to any earnest
voice that pleads for the city that should be. And,
indeed, other volumes which Dr. Smith himself has in
preparation, as suggestive and as interesting as this
one, may help us on in this direction.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case left2">A great</span> problem was left for the
first civilized inhabitants of New
York to determine. Nature had
made ample provision for the
metropolis of the western hemisphere.
But two possibilities
were attached to its occupation
by man—it could be healthy or unhealthy, at
the option of the people.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> conditions which made for health were:
two large rivers of pure water, from the
mountains and the sea, flushed its shores,
carrying the outflow of its waste far away seaward;
its soil could be thoroughly drained; its
sewerage could be so

<span class="sni">Healthy or Unhealthy:<br>
Which?</span>

constructed as to convey
to the sea all
forms of domestic
waste and surface filth; its southern exposure
towards the ocean insured sunlight and sea
breezes; its inland situation supplied to its
atmosphere the life-giving virtues of abundant
vegetation; the climate was temperate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
The conditions which made for unhealthiness
were: large areas of sodden marsh lands; a
rock formation of shale, having a dip of the
strata, nearly perpendicular, admitting the flow
of surface water to great depths, thus poisoning
springs and wells; numerous streams flowing
into the rivers; large ponds of stagnant water;
fierce summer heat.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">From</span> the year 1622 to the year 1866, a period
of two hundred and forty-four years, the
people elected that the city should be unhealthy.
The land was practically undrained;
the drinking water was from shallow wells,
befouled by street, stable,

<span class="sni">Two Centuries and<br>
a Half Unhealthy</span>

privy, and other filth; there
were no adequate sewers to
remove the accumulating
waste; the streets were the receptacles of garbage;
offensive trades were located among the
dwellings; the natural water courses and springs
were obstructed in the construction of streets
and dwellings, thus causing soakage of large
areas of land, and stagnant pools of polluted
water.</p>

<p>Later, in these centuries of neglect of sanitary
precautions, came the immigrants from every
nation of the world, representing for the most
part the poorest and most ignorant class of their
respective nationalities. This influx of people
led to the construction of the tenement house by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
landowners, whose aim was to build so as to
incur the least possible expense and accommodate
the greatest possible number. In dark,
unventilated, uninhabitable structures these
wretched, persecuted people were herded together,
in cellars and garrets, as well as in the
body of the building, until New York had the
largest population to a square acre of any civilized
city.</p>

<p>The people had not only chosen to conserve
all the natural conditions unfavorable to health,
but had steadily added unhygienic factors in
their methods of developing the city.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> result was inevitable. New York gradually
became the natural home of every
variety of contagious disease, and the favorite
resort of foreign pestilences. Smallpox,
scarlet fever, measles, diphtheria, were domestic
pestilences with which the

<span class="sni">A Plague-Stricken<br>
Town</span>

people were so familiar
that they regarded them
as necessary features of
childhood. Malarial fevers, caused by the mosquitoes
bred in the marshes, which were perfect
culture-beds, were regularly announced in the
autumnal months as having appeared with their
“usual severity.” The “White Plague,” or consumption,
was the common inheritance of the
poor and rich alike.</p>

<p>With the immigrant, came typhus and typhoid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
fevers, which resistlessly swept through
the tenement houses, decimating the poverty-stricken
tenants. At intervals, the great oriental
plague, Asiatic cholera, swooped down upon the
city with fatal energy and gathered its enormous
harvest of dead. Even “Yellow Fever,” the great
pestilence of the tropics, made occasional incursions
and found a most congenial field for its
operations.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Failure</span> to improve the unhealthy conditions
of the city, and the tendency to aggravate
them by a large increase of the tenement-house
population, offensive trades, accumulations
of domestic waste, and the filth of
streets, stables, and privy

<span class="sni">Enormous Sacrifice<br>
of Life</span>

pits, then universal, caused
an enormous sacrifice of
life, especially among children.
This fact is strikingly illustrated by the
following comparison of figures taken from the
official records.</p>

<p>The standard ratio of deaths to the total living
in a community, where the death-rate is
normal under proper sanitary conditions, has
been fixed by competent authority at about 15
in 1,000 of population. The death-rate in New
York, in the five years preceding 1866, averaged
38 in 1,000 population, which is 23 in excess of
the normal standard of 15 in the 1,000. In a city
with a population of 1,000,000, the estimated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
population of New York in 1865, a death-rate
of 38 in the 1,000 means 23,000 deaths annually
from preventable diseases.</p>

<p>Mortality statistics computed on a scale of
forty years, the period during which New York
has been under an intelligent sanitary government,
still more impressively show the former
waste of life through municipal neglect of the
elementary principles of public hygiene. The
lesson which these figures teach should be engraven
on the memory of every man, woman,
and child. Our authority is the annual report
of the Department of Health of the City of New
York, for the year 1908, in which appears the
following statement.</p>

<p>“A remarkable decrease in the death-rate has
taken place within the past forty years, a decrease
comparing each decennial rate with the
one immediately preceding represented by
seven, seven, and eighteen per cent respectively,
and comparing that of the first decennium with
the individual year under review, a decrease of
forty-seven per cent.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case left2">Cholera</span> was approaching the
shores of England. The alarm
of the people was intense. The
enormous devastations of that
pestilence on its first and only
previous visit to that country, in
1832, were vividly recalled by

<span class="sni">The Scourge<br>
of 1849</span>

the elder people. The only known preventive
measures were “flight, fasting, and prayer.” As
the pestilence was believed to be
a “visitation of God” on account
of the sins of the people, the
clergy petitioned the Prime Minister
to proclaim a day of “fasting and prayer,”
with many expressions of sorrow at the prevailing
national vices which had finally provoked
the wrath of the Almighty. The Prime Minister
replied in substance as follows:</p>

<p>“Do works meet for repentance. First make
your homes and their surroundings clean and
wholesome; then you may with propriety ask
Almighty God to bless your efforts at protection
against the approaching epidemic.”</p>

<p>This response of the highest official of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
Kingdom to the usually humble and devout petition
of the clergy, when the people were threatened
with an epidemic, was received with
profound astonishment by the religious classes,
with ridicule by the masses of the people, but
with commendation by sanitarians. The popular
agitation was great. The clergy protested
with solemn asseverations their belief that pestilences
were always indications that national
sins had become intolerable to the Almighty,
and only fastings and prayers could appease
His wrath.</p>

<p>The people at large gave no heed either to the
clergy’s admonition to fast and pray, or to the
Prime Minister’s advice to clean their homes
and their surroundings; but, with their usual
disregard of the domestic diseases with which
they were constantly familiar, gave no thought
to approaching danger. But the sanitarians
very earnestly urged the people of their respective
localities to act upon the advice of the
Prime Minister, assuring them that cholera was
a disease which prevailed more generally and
severely in localities and homes where there
was the greatest amount of “filth.”</p>

<p>The epidemic of 1849 came and went with its
apparent usual great disturbances of the people.
“Flight” and “fasting and prayers” had their
natural results, the former being effectual when
undertaken in time, and the latter without sensible
influence over the mortuary records.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Then</span> the net results of this visitation of
cholera were officially determined by
the Registrar-General, one fact attracted
wide attention and created a profound and
lasting impression on the minds of the common
people. A town in the interior

<span class="sni">Can Diseases<br>
Be Prevented?</span>

of England reported no case
of cholera, though the epidemic
had prevailed with great
virulence in the communities surrounding it.</p>

<p>On inquiry as to the cause of this remarkable
feature of a pestilence that hitherto had shown
no respect for persons or localities, it was
learned that certain citizens of this town were
deeply impressed with the reasonableness of the
Prime Minister’s suggestions, and had organized
and taken action accordingly. Volunteer committees
composed of the leading men and women
were selected. One was to secure thorough
cleaning of the streets and public places; another
was to cause an inspection of every residence
and its surroundings and secure complete
cleanliness; a third was to obtain reports of all
cases of sickness and require immediate isolation
and treatment when there was the slightest
symptom of cholera.</p>

<p>This town had its “fastings and prayers,” but
not until its citizens had done works meet for
repentance; and then it asked the divine blessing
on its efforts to protect itself—and its
prayers were abundantly answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
But there was another phase of this place’s
experience not less impressive than its escape
from cholera. There was a great diminution of
such diseases as diphtheria, typhoid, erysipelas,
scarlet fever, measles, and other low forms of
sickness, so fatal in the homes of the poor, during
the period that the citizens exercised so
much care in securing cleanliness.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">“A</span> word fitly spoken is like apples of
gold in pictures of silver.” A word
fitly spoken broke the spell of centuries,
and completely revolutionized human
history. That word was spoken, not at the suggestion
of science, nor by a

<span class="sni">The Word Fitly<br>
Spoken</span>

scientist, but, at the dictation
of common sense, by a layman
who happened to be in
authority. It was a plain, simple word, which
was understood by the people and which appealed
to their common sense.</p>

<p>A new era now dawned upon the domestic life
of the English people. Every household learned
that cleanliness had not only saved a town from
a visitation of cholera, but had reduced the
contagious and infectious diseases always present
in their homes. The Health Officer of England
gave tremendous force to the revelation
that had been made by officially characterizing
and classifying cholera and the whole brood of
domestic scourges as “filth diseases.” This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
a most happy term, because it suggested not
only the source of these diseases, but the simple
and effectual remedy that every householder
could apply. It became popular in the sanitary
literature of the period, and thus permeated all
classes, until the most humble family knew its
import and complied with its suggestion.</p>

<p>The next visitation of cholera to England was
met by the simple remedy of domestic and civic
cleanliness; and so manifestly effectual was this
measure that the pestilence lost its former terrors.
But the great and lasting gain to the people,
which grew out of the original proclamation
of the Prime Minister that cleanliness of the
home and its surroundings was the best preventive
of cholera, was the discovery of the fact that
nearly all diseases which afflict the individual
family, and in a larger sense the whole community,
have their origin in or are intensified by
decomposing waste matter, the “filth” of the
sanitarian, in and around their homes.</p>

<p>So profoundly impressed with this fact were
the laboring classes, and so earnest did they become
in their zeal for sanitation, that sanitary
measures entered into the political campaign.
On one occasion a prominent candidate was so
disturbed by the numerous inquiries which the
audience made as to his views in relation to
current questions of local sanitation, that he
cried out in despair, “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sanitas sanitatum, et omnia
sanitas!</i>”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case left2">During</span> the score of years that the
great awakening of the people
of England to the value of cleanliness
of the individual, the
home, and the municipality, as
the true remedial measure
against foreign as well as domestic
pestilences was in progress, extending

<span class="sni">Apathy in the<br>
United States</span>

from 1846 to 1866, the people of the United
States remained profoundly
apathetic in relation to all
questions of improvement of
the public health and the prevention
of epidemics. Cholera ravaged their
cities in 1849, and again in 1854, without meeting
other obstruction than the occasional fumes
of sulphur. Days of fasting and prayer were
religiously observed; but, for the most part, the
terror-stricken people fled to the country to
escape what they believed to be inevitable death
if they remained in their town homes.</p>

<p>The object lesson which the people of England
had learned from the experience of one
town, and had so successfully applied in several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
visitations of epidemics, was known to a few
students of sanitary science and administration
in different parts of this country and efforts
had been made by them, from time to time, to
awaken public interest in sanitation of the home
and the municipality, but very little progress
was made. A few cities had health organizations
which, for the most part, were devoted to
political schemes and purposes, with no pretense
to knowledge of the objects or methods
of sanitation.</p>

<p class="section al"><span class="dc">As</span> the simple suggestion of the Prime Minister,
that cleanliness of the home and its surroundings
was the best measure of protection
against cholera, contained the germ of
practical sanitary reform in England, so an incident
in the writer’s experience

<span class="sni">An Incident<br>
That Counted</span>

became the potential force that
gave to New York a most complete
system of health laws and
ordinances, and an efficient administrative department
of health. In a larger sense it may,
with justice, be claimed that this incident contained
the germ of health reform that has given
to this entire country the most perfect system
of municipal, state, and national health administration
in the civilized world.</p>

<p>The incident referred to occurred in the fifties
of the last century. New York was in the grip
of the deadly typhus. This was sometimes called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the “Spotted Fever,” from the dark spots which
appeared on the body of its victims, and also
“Emigrant Fever,” because it was brought to
this country by the immigrants, especially by
those who came from Ireland. Indeed, the Irish
immigrants suffered so generally and severely
that the disease was sometimes called the “Irish
Fever.” Immigration from Ireland was at that
time at its flood and the typhus was so prevalent
among these poverty-stricken people that the
hospitals were overcrowded by them and large
numbers were treated in tents, both on Blackwell’s
Island and at the quarantine grounds on
Staten Island.</p>

<p>Having completed a two years’ term of service
on the interne medical staff of Bellevue Hospital,
where large numbers of typhus cases were
treated, I was placed in charge of the tents on
Blackwell’s Island by the Commissioner of
Charities. Soon after entering upon the service,
I noticed that patients were continually admitted
from a single building in East Twenty-second
Street.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Impressed</span> with the importance of closing
this fever-nest, I visited the tenement and
was not surprised at the large number of cases
of fever which it furnished our hospital. It is
difficult to describe the scene that the interior

<span class="sni">A Fever<br>
Nest</span>

of the house presented to the visitor. The
building was in an extreme state of dilapidation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
generally; the doors and windows were broken;
the cellar was partly filled with filthy
sewage; the floors were littered with
decomposing straw, which the occupants
used for bedding; every
available place, from cellar to garret, was
crowded with immigrants—men, women, and
children. The whole establishment was reeking
with filth, and the atmosphere was heavy
with the sickening odor of the deadly typhus,
which reigned supreme in every room.</p>

<p>The necessity of immediately closing this
house to further occupation by immigrants, until
it was thoroughly cleansed and made decently
habitable, was imperative, and I made inquiries
for the responsible owner. I found that the
house was never visited by anyone who claimed
to be either agent or owner; but that it was the
resort of vagrants, especially of the most recent
and destitute immigrants; that they came and
went without let or hindrance, generally remaining
until attacked by the prevailing epidemic of
fever, when they were removed to the fever
hospital.</p>

<p class="section al"><span class="dc">After</span> considerable inquiry in the neighborhood
I found a person who was the real
agent of the landlord; but no other information
could be obtained than that the owner took
no interest in the property, and that the agent

<span class="sni">The Unknown<br>
Owner</span>

was under instructions not to reveal the owner’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
name. A suggestion to this agent, to have the
house vacated and put in good
condition for tenants, was
refused with a contemptuous
remark as to the absurdity of
furnishing such vagrants and immigrants better
quarters in which to live.</p>

<p>As there was no Health Department to which
an appeal could be made, the Metropolitan Police
Department was visited and the matter laid
before its president, Mr. Acton. He directed the
secretary, Mr. Hawley, a lawyer, to examine the
health laws and ordinances to determine what
measures were in the power of the police to enforce.
A search was made, and the result was
that neither law nor ordinance under which the
police could take action was found. Mr. Acton
advised that the tax lists be examined, to find
who paid taxes on the property, and thus discover
the responsible party to its ownership, and
then that appeal be made directly to him
to authorize the necessary improvements. An
examination of the tax list revealed that the
owner was a wealthy man, living in an aristocratic
neighborhood, a member of one of the
most popular churches of the city.</p>

<p>The condition of his tenement house was
brought to his attention, and its menace to the
public health as a fruitful fever nest was explained.
He was very angry at what he declared
was an interference with the management of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
property, and asserted, in the most emphatic
manner, that as the house yielded him no rent,
he would not expend a dollar for the benefit of
the miserable creatures who had so wrecked the
building.</p>

<p>With the failure of this appeal to the owner,
I had exhausted, apparently, every legal and
moral means of abating a nuisance dangerous
to life and detrimental to health.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">In</span> this extremity I visited the office of the <i>Evening
Post</i> and explained the matter to Mr. William Cullen Bryant,
then editor of that
newspaper. He was at once interested in the
failure of the power of the City Government to

<span class="sni">Fear of<br>
Publicity</span>

remedy such a flagrant evil. In the
absence of laws and ordinances, Mr.
Bryant proposed to make the case
public in all of its details, and for that
purpose suggested that the police should cause
the arrest of the delinquent owner, and he would
send a reporter to make notes of the case. A
charge was made against the landlord, and he
was required to appear at the Jefferson Market
Court. On entering the court he was confronted
by the reporter, pad and pencil in hand, who
pressed him with questions as to his tenement
house.</p>

<p>Greatly alarmed at his situation, the owner
inquired as to the purpose of the reporter, and
was informed that Mr. Bryant intended to publish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
the proceedings of the court in the <i>Evening
Post</i>, and to expose his maintenance of a fever
nest of the worst description. He begged that
no further proceedings be taken, and promised
the court that he would immediately make all
necessary improvements. He promptly vacated
the house, and made such a thorough reconstruction
of the entire establishment that it became
one of the most attractive tenements in that East
Side district. For many years that house continued
to be entirely free from the ordinary contagious
diseases of the tenement houses of the
city. It is an interesting fact that the landlord
subsequently thanked the writer for having compelled
him to improve his tenement house; for
he had secured first-class tenants who paid him
high rents.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">This</span> incident came to the attention of several
prominent citizens, physicians, lawyers, and
clergymen, who became profoundly impressed
with the revelation that there were no
laws under which such a glaring violation of the
simplest principles of health, and

<span class="sni">Agitation for<br>
Reform</span>

even of common decency, could
be at once corrected.</p>

<p>For many years there had been
a growing sentiment in favor of a reform of our
health regulations, stimulated by the writings of
Dr. John H. Griscom, Dr. Joseph M. Smith, Dr.
Elisha Harris, and others, and the Academy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Medicine had occasionally passed resolutions favoring
adequate health laws; but no results had
been secured.</p>

<p>It was now resolved to organize a society
devoted expressly to sanitary reform, and the
“Sanitary Association” came into existence. For
several years this body annually introduced a
health bill into the Legislature, but the measure
was regularly defeated through the active opposition
of the City Inspector, whose office would
be abolished if the bill became a law.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">In</span> the early sixties the famous “Citizens Association”
was organized, with Peter Cooper
as President, and a membership of one hundred
of the most prominent citizens. This was
in the days of the Tweed régime, and at a period
when the City Government was

<span class="sni">The Citizens<br>
Association</span>

most completely in his power.
The objects of the Association
were reform in all branches of
the Municipal Government, the promotion of
wise legislation, and the defeat of all attempts
to subordinate the city to the schemes for control
by Tweed and the coterie of politicians who
were under his directions.</p>

<p>The friends of sanitary reform decided to attempt
to secure proper legislation through the
Citizens Association. The application, by a delegation,
for the aid of this Association was well
received and a plan of procedure adopted. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
secretary of the Citizens Association, Mr. Nathaniel
Sands, had been a member of the Sanitary
Association, and as an enthusiastic sanitarian
had been disappointed at its repeated failure
to secure legislation. At his suggestion, it
was decided to create two committees, one on
health and another on law, and through these
agencies to have the Citizens Association accomplish
its work. The first committee eventually
came under my direction, while the second
was directed by Dorman B. Eaton, Esq.</p>

<p>In the Committee on Public Health were
many of the more prominent medical men of
that period, as Dr. Valentine Mott, Dr. Joseph
M. Smith, Dr. James R. Wood, Prof. John W.
Draper, Dr. Willard Parker, Dr. Isaac E. Taylor.
The Committee on Law was equally distinguished
for its membership, having on its list
the names of William M. Evarts, Charles Tracy,
D.&nbsp;B. Silliman.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">It</span> was determined, as a preliminary step, to
prepare a “Health Bill” and introduce it into
the Legislature, which was that of 1864, and
thus learn the obstacles to be met; for efforts
had repeatedly been made to pass health bills

<span class="sni">A Health<br>
Bill</span>

without success. The bill was drawn
along the lines of previous bills, and
was altogether inadequate in its
provisions to effect the required reforms.
The effort, however, developed the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
that the real opposition to health legislation was
the City Inspector’s Department. As that department
exercised all of the health powers, any
proper health bill would abolish it altogether.</p>

<p>The City Inspector, at that time, was a grossly
ignorant politician, but as he had upwards of
one million of dollars at his disposal, he had a
prevailing influence in the Legislature when
any bill affected his interests. At the hearing
on the Association’s bill, the City Inspector’s
agents denied every allegation as to the unsanitary
condition of the city, and as the Association
had no definite information as to the facts asserted,
the bill failed, as had all the bills of the
Sanitary Association during the previous ten
years.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">In</span> conference it was now decided to make a
thorough sanitary inspection of the city by
a corps of competent physicians, draft a new
and much more comprehensive measure, and
thus be prepared to confront the City Inspector
with reliable facts in

<span class="sni">Sanitary Inspection<br>
of New York</span>

regard to the actual
condition of the city.
The Citizens’ Association
consented to bear the expense of the undertaking.</p>

<p>Under the auspices of the Association, and in
the absence of the secretary of the Committee
on Health, Dr. Elisha Harris, who was at that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
time in the service of the United States Sanitary
Association, I organized and supervised the inspection.
The corps of inspectors consisted of
young physicians, each assigned to one of the
districts into which the city was divided. The
work was completed during the summer months
of 1864, and the original reports of the inspectors
were bound in seventeen large folio volumes.
These reports were afterwards edited
by the secretary, Dr. Elisha Harris, and published
by the Association in a volume of over
500 pages. The total cost to the Association of
this inspection and publication was $22,000; but
it richly repaid the Association, for it accomplished
the object for which it was undertaken.</p>

<p>This volunteer sanitary inspection of a great
city was regarded by European health authorities
as the most remarkable and creditable in
the history of municipal reform. Too much
credit can not be given to the President of the
Association, Peter Cooper, and to the Secretary,
Nathaniel Sands, for the constant support which
they gave the Committee on Health in the prosecution
of this great undertaking.</p>

<p>Meantime the Committee on Law perfected a
bill to be introduced at the coming session of
the Legislature, 1865. It was the joint product
of the Medical and Law Committees, and was
made the subject of extensive study and research,
in order to embody in it every provision
essential to its practical operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
At the request of the Committees I made the
first draft for the purpose of embodying the
sanitary features as the basis of the bill. Former
health bills were restricted in their operations
to the city of New York, and the officers were
appointed by the Mayor. As the government
of the city was dominated in all of its departments
by Tweed, it was decided to place the
proposed new health organization under the
control of the State, by making a Metropolitan
Health District, the area of which should be
co-extensive with that of the Metropolitan Police
District. This feature of the bill was also
important because the protection of the city
from contagious diseases in outlying districts
required that the jurisdiction of the Board
should extend to contiguous populations.</p>

<p>The original draft having been approved by
the Committee on Health, Mr. Eaton was requested
to perfect the bill by adding the legal
provisions. As he had recently made a study of
the English health laws, he incorporated many
items especially relating to the powers of the
Board which were quite novel in this country.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">One</span> feature of the bill deserves mention; for
it is an anomaly in legislation and apparently
violates the most sacred principle of
justice; viz., the power of the courts to review
the proceedings of a health board. The Committees

<span class="sni">An Anomaly<br>
in Law</span>

concluded that a board which was authorized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
to abate nuisances “dangerous to life
and detrimental to health” should
not be subjected to the possible
liability of being interrupted in
its efforts to abate them by
an injunction that would delay its action. Accordingly
the law as so drawn that the Metropolitan
Board was empowered to create ordinances,
to execute them in its own time and
manner, and to sit in judgment on its own acts,
without the possibility of being interrupted by
review proceedings or injunctions by any court.</p>

<p>Its power was made autocratic. The language
of that portion of the bill conveying these powers
was purposely made very technical, in order
that only a legal mind could interpret its full
meaning, it being believed that the ordinary
legislator would not favor the measure if he
understood its entire import. It is an interesting
fact that the first case brought into court
under the law was an effort to prove the unconstitutionality
of this feature; but it was carried
to the Court of Appeals, and its constitutionality
was sustained by a majority of one.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">On</span> the assembling of the Legislature of 1865
the Metropolitan Health Bill was formally
introduced into both houses, and preparations
made to secure its passage. Mr. Eaton was
selected by the Citizens’ Association to advocate

<span class="sni">Introduction of an<br>
Epoch-Making Bill</span>

the legal provisions of the bill at the hearings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
before the committees of the Legislature, and I
was delegated to explain
the sanitary requirements
of the measure. The first
hearing occurred on the
thirteenth of February, before a joint committee
of both houses, Hon. Andrew D. White,
senator, presiding. A large audience was present,
including the City Inspector and the usual
retinue of office holders in his department. The
Citizens Association was represented by Rev.
Henry W. Bellows, Dr. James R. Wood, Dr.
Willard Parker, Prof. John W. Draper, and several
other prominent citizens, in addition to Mr.
Eaton and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. Eaton first addressed the committee, and
made an admirable presentation of the legal
features of the bill. He eloquently appealed
for its enactment into law, in order to create
in New York a competent health authority, with
power to relieve the city of its gross sanitary
evils and adopt and enforce measures for the
promotion of the public health.</p>

<p>I followed him, my task being to show, from
the existing condition of the city, the imperative
need of such legislation. My remarks on the
occasion were published in <i>The New York
Times</i> of March 16, 1865.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case left3">MR. CHAIRMAN:</span> I have been requested
to lay before you some
of the results of a sanitary inspection
of New York City, undertaken
and prosecuted to a
successful completion by a voluntary
organization of citizens.
There has long been a settled conviction in the
minds of the medical men of New York, that
that city is laboring under
sanitary evils of which it
might be relieved. This
opinion is not mere conjecture,
but it is based upon the daily observations
which they are accustomed to make in the pursuit
of professional duties.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Familiar,</span> by daily study, with the causes of
diseases, and the laws which govern their
spread, they have seen yearly accumulating
about and within the homes of the laboring
classes all the recognized causes of the most

<span class="sni">Alarm of Medical<br>
Men</span>

preventible diseases, without a solitary measure
being taken by those in authority to apply an
effectual remedy. They have seen the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
crowded into closer and closer quarters, until
the system has actually become one of tenant-house
packing. They have witnessed the prevalence
of terrible and fatal epidemics, having
their origin in or intensified by these conditions,
and many of their professional brethren have
perished in the courageous performance of
their duties to the poor and suffering.</p>

<p>Cognizant of these growing evils, and believing
that they are susceptible of removal, they
have repeatedly and publicly protested against
the longer tolerance of such manifest causes of
disease and death in our city. Large bodies of
influential citizens have been equally impressed
with the importance of radical reform in the
health organizations of New York, and have
strenuously labored, but in vain, to obtain
proper legislative enactments.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">To</span> give practical effect to their efforts, it was
determined in May last to undertake a systematic
investigation of the sanitary condition
of the city. For this purpose a central organization
was formed, and when I mention the
names of its leading members, I

<span class="sni">A Systematic<br>
Investigation</span>

give you the best assurance that
the work was undertaken in the
interests of science and humanity.
The president was Dr. Joseph M. Smith,
one of the ablest writers on sanitary science in
this country, and among its members were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
Drs. Valentine Mott, James Anderson, Willard
Parker, Alonzo Clark, Gurdon Buck, James R.
Wood, Charles Henschel, Alfred C. Post, Isaac
E. Taylor, John W. Draper, R. Ogden Doremus,
Henry Goulden, Henry D. Bulkley, and Elisha
Harris.</p>

<p>In prosecuting this inquiry the Association
was guided by the experience of similar organizations
in Great Britain, where sanitary science
is now cultivated with the greatest zeal, and is
yielding the richest fruits. As a preliminary
step to the introduction of sanitary reforms,
many of the populous towns of England made
a more or less complete inspection of the homes
of the people to determine their condition, and
to enable them to arrive at correct conclusions
as to the required remedial measures. The
English Government undertook a similar investigation
through its “Commissioners for Inquiring
into the State of Large Towns and
Populous Districts,” and the voluminous and
exhaustive reports of that Commission laid the
foundation of the admirable sanitary system of
that country.</p>

<p>The first object of sanitary organization was
apparently, therefore, to obtain detailed information
as to the existing causes of disease
and the mortality of the population, and as to
the special incidence of that mortality upon
each sex, and each age, on separate places,
on various occupations; in fact, to present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
a detailed account of what may be called, in
commercial phrase, our transactions in human
life.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Evidently</span> the best method of arriving at
such knowledge was by a systematic inspection.
And that inspection must be a
house-to-house visitation, in which the course
of inquiry not only developed all the facts relating
to the sanitary, but

Inspection</span>

equally to the social condition
of the people. It
must necessarily be required
of the inspector that he visit every house,
and every family in the house, and learn by
personal examination, inquiry, and observation,
every circumstance, external and internal to the
domicile, bearing upon the health of the individual.</p>

<p>To perform such service satisfactorily, skilled
labor must be employed. No student of general
science, much less a common artisan, was qualified
to undertake this investigation into the
causes of disease; however patent these causes
might be, he had no power to appreciate their
real significance. Minds trained by education,
and long experience in observing and treating
the diseases of the laboring classes, could alone
thoroughly and properly accomplish the work
proposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Happily,</span> experts were at hand and prepared
to enter upon the task, viz.: the dispensary
physicians. The daily duties of these practitioners
have been for years to practice among
the poor, and study minutely their diseases;
and thus they have gained an

<span class="sni">The Medical<br>
Experts</span>

extensive and accurate knowledge
of the sanitary and social
condition of the mass of the people.
Many of these practitioners have been engaged
in dispensary service, and in a single district,
for ten to twenty years. They have thus
become so familiar with the poor of their district,
though often numbering 40,000 to 50,000,
that they know the peculiarities of each house,
the class of disease prevalent each month of the
year, and to a large extent the habits, character,
etc., of the families which occupy them.</p>

<p>From this class of medical men the Council
selected, as far as possible, its corps of Inspectors.
As a body, they represent the best medical
talent of the junior portion of the profession
of New York. Many occupy high social
positions, and all were men of refinement, education,
and devotion to duty. They entered
upon the work with the utmost enthusiasm;
engaging in it as a purely scientific study.</p>

<p>Everywhere the people welcomed the Inspectors,
invited them to examine their homes, and
gave them the most ample details.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> plan of inspection adopted by the Council
was as follows: The city was divided into
thirty-one districts and an Inspector selected
for each, care being taken to assign to each inspector
a district with which he was most familiar.

<span class="sni">Plan of<br>
Inspection</span>

The Inspector was directed
to commence his inspection by first
traversing the whole district, to
learn its general and topographical
peculiarities. He was then to take up the
squares in detail, examining them consecutively
as they lie in belts.</p>

<p>Commencing at a given corner of his district,
he was first to go around the square and note:
1. Nature of the ground. 2. Drainage and
sewerage. 3. Number of houses in the square.
4. Vacant lots and their sanitary condition. 5.
Courts and alleys. 6. Rear buildings. 7. Number
of tenement houses. 11. Drinking shops,
brothels, gambling saloons, etc. 12. Stores and
markets. 13. Factories, schools, crowded buildings.
14. Slaughter-houses (describe particularly).
15. Bone and offal nuisances. 16.
Stables, etc. 17. Churches and school edifices.</p>

<p>Returning to the point of starting, he was to
commence a detailed inspection of each building,
noting: <i>a.</i> Condition and material of buildings.
<i>b.</i> Number of stories and their height.
<i>c.</i> Number of families intended to be accommodated,
and space allotted to each. <i>d.</i> Water
supply and house drainage. <i>e.</i> Location and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
character of water-closets. <i>f.</i> Disposal of garbage
and house slops. <i>g.</i> Ventilation, external
and internal. <i>h.</i> Cellars and basements, and
their population. <i>i.</i> Conditions of halls and
passages. <i>j.</i> Frontage on street, court, alley—N.,
E., S. or W. 18. Prevailing character of the
population. 19. Prevailing sickness and mortality.
20. Sources of preventible disease and
mortality. 21. Condition of streets and pavements.
22. Miscellaneous information.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">He</span> entered each room, examined its means of
ventilation and its contents, noted the number
of occupants by day and by night, and
carefully estimated the cubical area to each
person. Whenever any contagious or infectious
disease was discovered, as

<span class="sni">Each Room<br>
Examined</span>

fever, smallpox, measles, scarlatina,
the Inspector made a special
report upon the dwelling.
This report embodied specific answers to a
series of questions, furnished in a blank form,
requiring him 1. To trace and record the medical
history of the sick person. 2. To ascertain
and record facts relating to the family and other
persons exposed to the patients and to the
causes of the malady. 3. To report the sanitary
condition of the domicil. 4. To report the statistics
and sanitary condition of the population
of that domicil. 5. To report upon the sanitary
condition of the locality or neighborhood and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
its population. 6. To preserve and make returns
of these records. 7. To prepare on the
spot the necessary outlines or data for the
sketching of a map or descriptive chart of the
domicil, block, or locality.</p>

<p>Each Inspector was supplied with a notebook
and a permanent record-book; in the first
he constantly made notes as his examination
proceeded, and in the latter these notes were
expanded and put on permanent record. These
permanent record-books are the property of
the Association and embrace for the most part
minute details concerning every building and
tenement occupied by the laboring classes, as
also, grog-shops, stables, vacant lots, slaughter-houses,
etc.</p>

<p>Each Inspector was furnished with materials
for drawing, and was directed to make accurate
drawings of the squares in his district, locating
each building, vacant lot, etc., and distinguishing
the character and condition of each by an
appropriate color. Many of these drafts of
districts are beautiful specimens of art, and as
sanitary charts enable the observer to locate infectious
and contagious diseases, and with the
aid of the permanent records, to determine the
internal and external domiciliary conditions
under which they occur.</p>

<p>I have been thus minute in specifying the details
of the plan of inspection, the qualifications
of the Inspectors, and the means employed, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
order that the character of the work and the
value of the results obtained may be properly
appreciated.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Early</span> in the month of May the work of thoroughly
inspecting the insalubrious quarters,
where fever and other pestilential diseases
prevail, had been commenced, and the fact was
soon ascertained that smallpox and typhus fever
were existing and spreading

<span class="sni">Period of the<br>
Inspection</span>

in almost every crowded locality
of the city. It was not
until about the middle of July
that the entire corps of Inspectors was engaged.
The work was then prosecuted with vigor and
without interruption to the middle of November,
when it was completed. The Inspectors
met regularly every Saturday evening to report
to a committee on the part of the Council the
progress of their work, and to receive advice
and instruction in regard to all questions of a
doubtful character.</p>

<p>On the completion of the inspection each Inspector
was required to prepare a final report
embodying the general results of his labors.
These reports have all been properly collated,
under the direction of the Association, and are
now passing through the press. They will soon
appear in an octavo volume of about 400 pages,
largely illustrated, with maps and diagrams. It
will be the first interior view of the sanitary and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
social condition of the population of New York,
and will abundantly demonstrate the fact that,
though a great and prosperous commercial
centre, she does not afford happy homes to hundreds
of thousands.</p>

<p class="section b"><span class="dc">Before</span> proceeding to an analysis of this
work, it will be necessary to notice the topographical
peculiarities of our city, and the
distribution of its population. New York is an
island having an area of about thirty-four
square miles, inclusive of its

<span class="sni">Distribution of<br>
Population</span>

parks. Unlike Philadelphia,
London, and most other large
cities, which have a background
of hundreds of square miles upon which
to extend according to the exigencies of the
population or of business, New York is limited
in its power of expansion, and must accommodate
itself to its given area. While it is true that a
large business population will gather upon the
adjacent shores, it is equally true that these
non-residents will be of the better class. The
laboring population will, for the most part, remain
upon the island, and must be accommodated
in the city proper, as they are compelled
to live near their work.</p>

<p>New York has, thus far, grown without any
control or supervision, until its population is
estimated at 1,000,000 of persons. Of this number,
at least one-half are of the laboring and dependant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
classes, compelled to live under such
conditions as they find in their homes, without
any power, either to change or improve them.
Following the natural law which governs the
movements of such a population, the wealthier
or independent class spreads itself with its business
arrangements over the larger proportion
of the area, and the poorer or dependent class
is crowded into the smallest possible space.</p>

<p class="section al"><span class="dc">Already</span> New York has covered about 8 of
its 34 square miles with the dwellings of a
population not far from 1,000,000, and all
its commercial and manufacturing establishments.
And the result is, as might have been
anticipated, the dependent

<span class="sni">Tenant-House<br>
Packing</span>

class, numbering fully one-half
of the people, is crowded
into tenant-houses which occupy
an area of not more than two square
miles. Such crowding amounts literally to
packing.</p>

<p>For example, it is estimated that there are
three contiguous blocks of tenant-houses which
contain a larger population than Fifth Avenue;
or, again, if Fifth Avenue had front and rear
tenant-houses as densely packed as tenant-houses
generally are, there would be a population
of 100,000 on that single avenue. A single
tenant-court in the Fourth Ward is arranged
for the packing of 1,000 persons.</p>

BY 111 FAMILIES, AND BY STABLES, SOAP
FACTORY, AND TANYARD</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
A resident of the same Ward reports that:
“On a piece of ground 240 feet by 150, there are
20 tenant-houses, occupied by 111 families, 5
stables, a large soap and candle factory, and a
tan-yard, the receptacle of green hides. The
filth and stench of this locality are beyond any
power of description.” In general, it may be
stated that the average number of families to
a house among the poor is 7, or about 35 persons.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">It</span> is necessary also to make a single explanation,
to render more apparent the bearing of
the facts developed. For the purposes of
sanitary inquiry, the causes of disease are divided
into those which are inevitable, and those

<span class="sni">Avoidable and<br>
Inevitable Disease</span>

which are avoidable or removable,
and hence it follows
that diseases and
deaths are divided into
those which are inevitable and those which are
preventable. For example: Of unavoidable
causes of disease, we have vicissitudes of
weather, accidents, old age, physical degenerations,
etc.</p>

<p>Of avoidable or removable causes of disease
we have those conditions around or within our
dwellings or places of business or resort, errors
in our mode of living, etc., which vitiate health,
or rather tend to diseases, and yet which can
be removed or changed by human agency. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
example, a country residence may be most
favorably located for health, and yet decaying
vegetable matter in the cellar, or a cesspool so
situated as to allow the gaseous emanations to
be diffused through the house, will expose all
the inmates to fevers, diarrhoea and dysentery.</p>

<p>These would be preventable diseases, and all
the deaths therefrom would be preventable, and
hence unnecessary deaths. In like manner in
cities, all diseases and deaths due to causes
which human agencies can remove are preventable.
And it is a melancholy fact that fifty per
cent of the mortality of cities is estimated to be
due to such causes, and is hence unnecessary.</p>

<p>In reviewing the result of this inspection, I
shall call your attention only to the more patent
causes of disease found existing, and to the
preventable diseases discovered, and their relation
to these causes. In this evidence you will
find ample proof that radical reforms are required
in the health organizations of New York.</p>

<p class="section i"><span class="dc">I</span> will first notice the causes of disease which
exist external to our dwellings, and which
are the most readily susceptible of remedy.
The first that attracts attention in New York is
the condition of the streets. No one can

<span class="sni">Filthy<br>
Streets</span>

doubt that if the streets in a thickly
populated part of a town are made the
common receptacle of the refuse of
families, that in its rapid decomposition a vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
amount of poisonous gases must escape, which
will impregnate the entire district, penetrate
the dwellings, and render the atmosphere in
the neighborhood in a high degree injurious to
the public health. In confirmation of this statement,
I will quote the City Inspector, who, in a
former communication to the Common Council,
says:</p>

<p>“As an evidence of the effect of this state of
things upon the health of the community, I
would state that the mortality of the city, from
the first of March, has been largely on the increase,
until it has now reached a point of fearful
magnitude. For the week ending April 27th,
there were reported to this department one
hundred and forty more deaths than occurred
during the same week of the previous year.
Were this increase of mortality the result of an
existing pestilence or epidemic among us, the
public would become justly alarmed as to the
future; but although no actual pestilence, as
such, exists, it is by no means certain that we
are not preparing the way for some fatal
scourge by the no longer to be endured filthy
condition of our city.”</p>

<p>The universal testimony of the sanitary inspectors
is that in all portions of the city occupied
by the poorer classes, the streets are in the
same filthy condition as that described by the
City Inspector, and, that street filth is one of the
most fruitful causes of disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p class="section s"><span class="dc">Says</span> the Inspector of the Eighth Ward:
“Laurens, Wooster, Clark, and Sullivan are
in a most filthy condition, giving off insalubrious
emanations on which depend the many
cases of fever, cholera infantum, dysentery,
and pulmonary diseases. I have

<span class="sni">Street Filth<br>
and Disease</span>

observed that near where other
streets cross the above-named
streets there is a greater proportionate
amount of sickness; and this fact I have
shown by special reports of typhus and typhoid
fever in Grand and Broome, and dysentery in
Spring.”</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: “Domestic
garbage and filth of every kind is thrown
into the streets, covering their surface, filling the
gutters, obstructing the sewer culverts, and
sending forth perennial emanations which must
generate pestiferous disease. In winter the filth
and garbage, etc., accumulate in the streets, to
the depth sometimes of two or three feet. The
garbage boxes are a perpetual source of nuisance
in the streets, filth and offal being thrown
all around them, pools of filthy water in many
instances remaining in the gutters, and having
their source in the garbage boxes.”</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Seventh Ward says:
“The whole most easterly portion of the district,
the streets and gutters are very filthy with mud,
ashes, garbage, etc.”</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Thirteenth Ward says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
“The streets are generally in a filthy and unwholesome
condition; especially in front of the
tenant-houses, from which the garbage and
slops are, to a great extent, thrown into the
streets, where they putrefy, rendering the air
offensive to the smell and deleterious to health.
The refuse of the bedrooms of those sick with
typhoid and scarlet fevers and smallpox is frequently
thrown into the streets, there to contaminate
the air, and, no doubt, aid in the
spread of those pestilential diseases.”</p>

<p>Says the Inspector of the Ninth Ward: “The
effect of dirty streets upon the public health is
too well known, and too often insisted upon, to
need any exposition in this report. The largest
number of cases of cholera infantum, cholera
morbus, and kindred disease, is always found
in localities where the streets are dirtiest.”</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Seventeenth Ward
writes: “The two following localities present
the appearance of dung-hills rather than the
thoroughfares in a civilized city, viz.: Sixth
Street, between Bowery and Second Avenue,
and Eleventh Street, between First and Second
Avenues.”</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> Inspector of the Eleventh Ward says: “As
a rule, the streets are extremely dirty and
offensive, and the gutters obstructed with
filth. The filth of the streets is composed of

<span class="sni">Animals<br>
Dead</span>

house-slops, refuse vegetables, decayed fruit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
store and shop sweepings, ashes, dead animals,
and even human excrements. These
putrifying organic substances are
ground together by the constantly
passing vehicles. When dried
by the summer’s heat, they are driven by the
wind in every direction in the form of dust.
When remaining moist or liquid in the form of
“slush,” they emit deleterious and very offensive
exhalations. The reeking stench of the
gutters, the street filth, and domestic garbage of
this quarter of the city, constantly imperil the
health of its inhabitants. It is a well-recognized
cause of diarrhoeal diseases and fevers.”</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Eighteenth Ward reports:
“The streets in the eastern part of the
district, east of First Avenue especially, have,
for the past six months, been in a most inexcusably
filthy condition. The pavement here is uneven,
there are deep gutters at either side of
the streets, filled with foul slops, in which float
or are sunk every form of decaying animal and
vegetable matter. Occasionally, at remote and
irregular intervals, carts come round, these
stagnant pools are dredged, so to speak, and
their black and decayed solid contents raked
out. If there be anything on earth that is ‘rank
and smells to heaven,’ these gutters do on such
occasions, especially in the summer months.
The streets in this part of the city are the principal
depositories of garbage. In some instances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
heaped up at the sides of the streets, in others
thrown about promiscuously, the event in either
case is the same, if it be allowed to remain day
after day, as it usually is. After having passed
through every stage of decay, after having corrupted
the surrounding air with its pestilential
smell, it gradually becomes dessicated and converted
into dust by the summer sun and the
constantly passing vehicles. And now every
horse that passes stirs it up, every vehicle leaves
a cloud of it behind; it is lifted into the air with
every wind and carried in every direction.</p>

<p>“Those who are directly responsible for this
state of things suffer no more than the cleanly
and thrifty who are so unfortunate as to live
anywhere the wind, blowing from this quarter,
reaches them. And what a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pulvis compositum</i>
is it to breathe into the lungs! As we pass by,
our mouths become full of it, we draw it in with
our breath. It is swallowed into the stomach,
it penetrates our dress and clings until it
has covered our perspiring skin. Surely no
dumping-ground, no sewer, no vault, contains
more filth or in greater variety than did the air
in certain parts of our city during the long season
of drought the past summer. And wherever
the wind blows, the foul corruption is carried;
by a process as sure and universal as the diffusion
of gases, is it conveyed throughout the city.
Such, often, is the air drawn into the lungs with
every respiration, of the poor sufferer stifled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
with consumption or burning with fever. No
barrier can shut it out, no social distinction can
save us from it; no domestic cleanliness, no
private sanitary measures can substitute a pure
atmosphere for a foul one.”</p>

<p>But I need not multiply these quotations. It
will suffice to state that during the week ending
August 5th, a special inspection of all the
streets was made and they were found to be
reeking, and, indeed, almost impassable, with
filth. And to-day they are in, if possible, a still
worse condition than ever before.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Closely</span> allied to the streets are courts and
alleys. These cul-de-sacs leading to, and
adjoining the close and unventilated homes
of the poor, are almost universally in a more
filthy condition than the adjacent street. They
are the receptacles of much of

<span class="sni">Filthy Courts<br>
and Alleys</span>

the waste of the house, and are
rarely cleaned. The air of these
places during the summer is
often the most stifling and irrespirable, and yet
as it descends it enters the closely packed tenant-house
and furnishes to the inmates the
elements of disease and death. Says the Inspector
of the Fourth Ward:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
“Slops from rear buildings of such premises
are usually emptied into a shallow gutter cut in
the flagging and extending from the yard, or
space between front and rear buildings, to the
street. This is often clogged up by semi-fluid
filth, so that the alley and those parts of the
yard through which it runs are not infrequently
overflown and submerged to the depth of several
inches. There are more than four hundred
families in this district whose homes can only
be reached by wading through a disgusting deposit
of filthy refuse. In some instances, a staging
of plank, elevated a few inches above the
surface, is constructed through the alleys.”</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">In</span> the court is found generally that most
pestiferous of all the sources of civic uncleanliness
and unhealthiness—the privy and
cesspool. These receptacles are rarely drained

<span class="sni">Cesspool<br>
Abominations</span>

into the sewers, and consequently require for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
their cleanliness the frequent and faithful attention
of the scavenger. The reports
of the sanitary inspectors
prove that this work is most
irregularly and imperfectly
done. Hundreds of places were found where
these nuisances existed within, under or beside
large tenant-houses, creating a vast amount of
disease and death. Numerous instances of this
kind are detailed in these reports, which are almost
too revolting to be believed. I will quote
but one or two illustrations:</p>

<p>“The privies (two in one) of Nos. — and —
West Twenty-fourth Street need instant cleaning.
They are overflowing the yard, and are
very offensive. The privy No. — Seventh
Avenue, as in the preceding two adjoining
houses, is in the yard, and adjoins the house,
and is on a line with the southerly wall of house
No. — (the adjacent house), which has a back
area; the wall of said area being part of the
foundation of the privy. At times the fluid portion
of the privy oozes through its own and the
area wall.</p>

<p>“The privy of the rear tenant-house No. —
West Twenty-second Street is used by 42 persons;
it has five subdivisions, one for every two
families. The compartments are so small that
a person can scarcely turn round in them, and
so dark that they have to be entered with an
artificial light. The cellar itself, as has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
stated, is damp,
dark, and without
ventilation.
Under such circumstances
the
emanations of
the excrementious
matter of
42 persons can
find no escape;
thus this privy-cellar
is worse
than a Stygian
pit.”</p>

  <div class="caption">PLAN OF CELLAR</div></div>

<p>The Inspector
of the Fifth
Ward says: “Very few tenements have water-closets
in the house; they have privies in the
yards, which, as a rule, are insufficient for the
accommodation of the numbers crowded into
the houses; many are not connected with the
sewers; are seldom cleaned, being allowed to
overflow in some cases, rendering the neighborhood
offensive with insalubrious emanations.”</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Fourteenth Ward states
that: “The water-closets are nearly all in the
yards—but few being in the houses—and
connecting with the sewers. The greater number
of these sewers are in a filthy condition,
being but seldom emptied. Many of those
which communicate with the privies are choked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
up by all sorts of offal being thrown into them,
thereby producing a very bad condition.”</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> Inspector of the Seventeenth Ward reports:
“The privies of East Eleventh Street,
rear, are beneath the floored alley-way leading
to the building. Large holes in this floor
allow ocular inspection from above, and admit
rain and dirt. These nuisances

<span class="sni">Unbelievable<br>
Vileness</span>

are almost always overflowing,
and the passage leading to them
is full of fæcal matter. It would
seem impossible for human beings to create or
endure such vileness. The cellar is used by
children and others as a privy; the foul air there
seems never to change.”</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Sixteenth Ward says:
“The privies form one end of the chief features
of insalubrity. Nearly all of them are too small
in size and too few in number, and without
ventilation or seat-covers. About twelve were
found locked securely, and on procuring the key
and inspecting the privy, such masses of human
excrements were found on the seats and floors
as would justify the locking of the door to protect
unwary persons from injury. Occupants
of rear buildings are the principal sufferers
from this insalubrity. The proximity of privies
is in some cases eight feet from the windows of
rear houses; the odor in these is, especially at
night, intolerable. Instances of the kind are to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
be found at Nos. —, — and — West Seventeenth
Street, and others. They are also too few in
number; for example, No. — West Nineteenth
Street, where in the front and rear buildings
more than one hundred persons live who have
one common privy, with a single partition dividing
it, and but four seats in all. Twenty-five
persons are expected to use one seat-opening.”</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Twentieth Ward says:
“During my inspection I reported a number
which were filled, and at the same time in such
need of repair as to hazard the lives of those
who entered them. The proximity of these
places to the houses in many cases is a fact to
which I would call your attention. One instance
of this kind I may state: At a house in Fortieth
Street, between Broadway and Seventh Avenue,
the privy is situated about 10 feet from the door,
and there is another on a line 10 feet from the
first, and still another within 10 feet of the last
mentioned, making three privies within 30 feet,
and two of these belong to houses fronting on
Broadway. The offensive odor arising from
these places contaminates the air of the houses
in the vicinity. This house, in Fortieth Street,
is actually unfit to live in. At the time of my
inspection the noxious gases from these privies
were strongly perceptible in every part of the
house.”</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Seventeenth Ward reports:
“The privies are in most cases in the rear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
court-yard. In about two-thirds of the houses
the privies are connected with the sewer. Overflowing
privies are frequently found. Sometimes
they are located in a dark place, which
in all cases must be considered an evil. Such
is the case in some houses in Rivington, Stanton,
Ninth and Eldridge streets. All these places
are filthy, and exceedingly offensive and dangerous
to the whole neighborhood; in some
places the foundation of the privies being rotten
and broken, and fæcal matter runs into the
cellar, as in No. — ‘Extra Place,’ where diseases
and deaths have occurred. The contents of a
privy in a court at No. — Fifth Street have, from
a similar cause, saturated the yard of premises
on the Bowery, where several children died
during the summer.”</p>

<p class="section i"><span class="dc">I</span> will at this point simply allude to special
nuisances. New York has within the narrow
limits of its present occupied area of about
eight square miles, in addition to its one million
of people, and all its commercial and manufacturing

<span class="sni">Special<br>
Nuisances</span>

establishments, a vast number
of special nuisances, which are,
to a greater or less degree, detrimental
to its public health.
There are nearly 200 slaughter-houses, many of
which are in the most densely populated districts.
To these places droves of cattle, hogs,
and sheep are constantly driven, rendering the
streets filthy in the extreme, and from them flow
blood and refuse of the most disgusting character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
In certain populous sections are fat-boiling,
entrails-cleansing, and tripe-curing establishments,
which poison the air for squares around
with their stifling emanations. To these must
be added hundreds of uncleaned stables, immense
manure heaps, etc., etc. But I shall not
dwell further on these subjects, and the evidence
regarding them.</p>

<p class="section i"><span class="dc">I</span> pass from the consideration of the external
to the internal domiciliary conditions. The
poorer classes of New York are found living
either in cellars or in tenement houses. It is
estimated by the City Inspector that 18,000 persons
live in cellars. This

<span class="sni">Cellar Population—<br>
Dens of Death</span>

is also about the estimate
of the police.
The apartments of these
people are not the light and airy basement
rooms of the better class houses, but their
homes are, in the worst sense, cellars. These
dark, damp and dreary abodes are seldom
penetrated by a ray of sunlight, or enlivened by
a breath of fresh air. I will quote several descriptions
from these reports. In the Fourth
Ward many of these cellars are below tide
water. Says the Inspector of that district:</p>

<p>“This submarine region is not only excessively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
damp, but is liable to sudden inroads from the
sea. At high tide the water often wells up
through the floors, submerging them to a considerable
depth. In very many cases the vaults
of privies are situated on the same or a higher
level, and their contents frequently ooze
through the walls into the occupied apartments
beside them. Fully one-fourth of these subterranean
domiciles are pervaded by a most
offensive odor from this source, and rendered
exceedingly unwholesome as human habitations.
These are the places in which we most
frequently meet with typhoid fever and dysentery
during the summer months. I estimate
the amount of sickness of all kinds affecting the
residents of basements and cellars, compared
with that occurring among an equal number of
the inhabitants of floors above ground, as being
about a ratio of 3 to 2.”</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Fifteenth Ward reports:
“In a dark and damp cellar, about 18 feet square
and 7 feet high, lived a family of seven persons;
within the past year two have died of typhus,
two of smallpox, and one has been sent to the
hospital with erysipelas. The tops of the windows
of this abode are below the level of the
surface, and in the court near are several privies
and a rear tenant-house. Yet this occurred but
a short distance from the very heart of the city.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">L, Living Room; D, Dormitory</span></p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
The Inspector of the Ninth Ward writes: “At
Nos. —, —, — and — Hammond Street, and also
at No. — Washington Street, are inhabited cellars,
the ceilings of which are below the level
of the street, inaccessible to the rays of the sun,
and always damp and dismal. Three of them
are flooded at every heavy rain, and require to
be baled out. They are let at a somewhat
smaller rent than is asked for apartments on an
upper floor, and are rented by those to whom
poverty leaves no choice. They are rarely vacant.”</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Seventeenth Ward states
that: “In 17 squares 55 houses contain 246 persons
living in cellars entirely underground. As
a matter of course such cellars are unhealthy
dwelling apartments. Stanton Place has some
of these miserable cellar-apartments, in which
diseases have been generated. These cellars
are entirely subterranean, dark and damp.”</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: “There
has been some improvement within the last
few years—the cellar population having
been perceptibly decreased, yet 496 persons
still live in damp and unwholesome quarters
under ground. In some of

<span class="sni">496 Persons<br>
Under Ground</span>

them water was discovered
trickling down the walls, the
source of which was sometimes
traced to the courts and alleys, and sometimes
to the soakage from the water-closets.
The noxious effluvia always present in these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
basements are of a sickening character. Many
of the cellars are occupied by two or three families;
a number are also occupied as lodging-houses,
accommodating from twenty to thirty
lodgers. One, near the corner of Elm and
Worth streets, is now fifteen or sixteen feet below
the level of the street (the street having been
raised ten feet). The lodging-house keeper
complained to the Inspector that her business
had fallen off some since the street was raised.
As might be expected, the sickness rate is very
high; rheumatic disease, fevers, strumous diseases,
cholera infantum, etc., etc., running riot
among the population. Indeed, in nearly every
basement disease of some kind has been found
peculiarly prevalent
and fatal.”</p>

<div id="ip_85" class="figleft" style="max-width: 14.4375em;">

  <div class="caption">PLAN OF CELLAR IN THE SIXTEENTH
WARD, 1865, OCCUPIED BY TWO
FAMILIES, EACH WITH A DARK
LIVING-ROOM, AND A DARK, DAMP
DORMITORY</div></div>

<p>Another Inspector
says: “At
No. — West Sixteenth
Street,
two families, in
which are thirteen
persons, occupy
the basement.
It is so
dark that ordinary
type can be
seen with difficulty.
In the other
case the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
were healthy before entering the basement;
since, however, they have been ill; the mother
has phthisis. Of twenty-four cellars, note of
which has been made, four only were in good
sanitary condition. The rest were more or less
filthy, some indescribably so. One contained
urine, bones, and soakage from the privy.”</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Eighteenth Ward writes:
“There are a few cellars so dark that one cannot
see to read in them, unless by artificial light,
except for a few hours in the day, by sitting
close to the window; and there are many basement
rooms into whose gloomy recesses not a
single direct ray from the sun ever shone. The
latter are, as a rule, by half their depth below
the level of the street. Dark and damp, with
very little chance for circulation of air, it would
be difficult to imagine a human being more completely
beyond reach of sanitary provisions.
And when we consider that four large families
often crowd this subterranean floor, no words
are needed to show their condition deplorable.
That a generally impaired vitality is promoted
by living in this unnatural way, ‘a nameless,
ever new disease,’ there can be no question;
that these people will be especially prone to
whatever form of prevailing sickness may be
about in the community, no one can doubt; but
whether there is any specific cause involved,
capable of producing definite forms of disease,
is more difficult to determine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p class="section al"><span class="dc">An</span> Inspector thus describes a visit to one of
these subterranean abodes: “We enter a
room whose low ceiling is blackened with
smoke, and its walls discolored with damp. In
front, opening on a narrow area covered with
green mould, two small windows,

<span class="sni">A Visit to the<br>
Cave-Dwellers</span>

their tops scarcely level
with the court-yard, afford at
noonday a twilight illumination
to the apartment. Through their broken
panes they admit the damp air laden with effluvia,
which constitutes the vital atmosphere
inhaled by all who are immured in this dismal
abode. A door at the back of this room communicates
with another which is entirely dark, and
has but this one opening. Both rooms together
have an area of about eighteen feet square.</p>

<p>“The father of the family, a day laborer, is
absent. The mother, a wrinkled crone at thirty,
sits rocking in her arms an infant whose pasty
and pallid features tell that decay and death
are usurping the place of health and life. Two
older children are in the street, which is their
only playground, and the only place where they
can go to breathe an atmosphere that is even
comparatively pure. A fourth child, emaciated
to a skeleton, and with that ghastly and unearthly
look which marasmus impresses on its
victims, has reared his feeble frame on a rickety
chair against the window sill, and is striving to
get a glimpse of the smiling heavens, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
light is so seldom permitted to gladden its longing
eyes. Its youth has battled nobly against
the terrible morbid and devitalizing agents
which have oppressed its childish life—the
poisonous air, the darkness, and the damp; but
the battle is nearly over—it is easy to decide
where the victory will be.”</p>

<p>But I need not multiply the evidences that
18,000 people, men, women, and children (a
goodly-sized town), are to-day living in our
city in a condition the most destructive to
health, happiness, and morals that could possibly
be devised. As you look into these abodes
of wretchedness, filth and disease, the inmates
manifest the same lethargic habits as animals,
burrowing in the ground. They are, indeed,
half narcotized by the constant inhalation of the
emanations of their own bodies, and by a prolonged
absence of light and fresh air. Here we
never find sound health, while the constant sickness
rate ranges from 75 to 90 per cent.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Now,</span> as to the second condition under which
we find the laboring classes. It is estimated
by the police that the tenant-house population
of New York reaches the enormous figure
of 500,000 or about half of the
total number of inhabitants.

<span class="sni">Tenant-House<br>
Population</span>

The great and striking fact in
regard to the domiciliary
condition of the tenant-house class is overcrowding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
and deficient sunlight and fresh air.
The landlord of the poor tenant-house has two
principal motives—first, to pack as many people
as he can in a given space, and second, to
make as few improvements and repairs as possible.</p>

<div id="ip_89" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.5625em;">
  <img src="books/1_files/i_089.jpg" width="377" height="206" alt="">
  <div class="caption">PLAN SHOWING REAR TENANT-HOUSES, NEAR A STABLE,
IN THE SEVENTEENTH WARD, 1865</div></div>

<p>The tenant-houses are of two classes, viz.,
the front and the rear. The latter is closely
allied to the cellar; being shut out from air and
sunlight, it is generally damp, gloomy, and
filthy. The space between the front and rear
house, familiarly called the “well hole,” contains
the privy and cesspool, the emanations
from which are closely confined to this space,
and slowly but constantly pervade with their
disgusting odors all the rooms and recesses.</p>

<p>The tenant-house has frequently been described<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
by sensation writers, with all its miseries,
its diseases and its deaths. But no pen
nor pencil can sketch the living reality. It is
only by personal inspection that one can learn
to what depths of social and physical degradation
human beings can descend. Said a committee
appointed by your body to investigate
the condition of the tenant-houses of New York:</p>

<p>“Sitting together upon the same broken box,
lying together upon the same dirty straw, covered
by the same filthy shreds, vieing with each
other in the utterance of foul obscenities, you
have a picture of the mass of corruption and
squalid misery gathered inside the walls of that
unventilated building in Mission Place. In that
single house there was that which made the soul
sicken and turn in horror from the sight. Vice,
with its pretentious brow, and wretchedness,
with hollow cheek and sunken, glazed eye, were
there; hunger and lust stood side by side, petit
larceny and cold-blooded murder were holding
converse.”</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> inspectors describe more or less minutely
a large number of tenant-houses, and also
of groups:</p>

<p>“‘Cat Alley’ is the local designation of a group
of dilapidated tenant-houses in an alley on
Cannon Street. The alley is unpaved, and is

<span class="sni">Cat<br>
Alley</span>

excessively filthy. The privy is a small and
broken-down structure, covering only a part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
the vault, which is now full almost to overflowing.
The inhabitants are degraded, both
physically and socially. In several of
the domiciles, at the time of our last inspection,
there was neither bedstead nor
table. Twelve of these families were found in a
wretched condition, and all the children we saw
were covered with dirt, and presented the intensest
aspects of scrofulous disease; their sore
eyes, encrusted heads, and dehumanizing appearance,
told the story of want and neglect, and
of greater evils to come.</p>

<p>“Five small houses, two and a half stories in
height, including the basements, each containing
apartments for six families, front on an alley
called Rivington Place. This alley is always in
a filthy condition. The houses on it are small
and overcrowded. The 30 families that reside
in these five houses have no other water supply
than that which two hydrants furnish in the exterior
courtyard; while for this population of
nearly 200 persons, of all ages, there are but two
privy vaults, and, at the time of the last inspection
of the quarters, these vaults were filled
nearly to the surface. In the year 1849, 42 individuals
died here in three weeks of cholera,
and not one recovered that was taken sick. The
reasons are plain: they have no ventilation, and
the houses being double, the exhalations from
one apartment are inhaled by the other.</p>

“At No. — West Twenty-fifth Street, a
wretched tenement of two apartments, the
rooms occupied by one family. The sitting-room
is about 10×12 feet, and the bedroom
about 5×12, without a single window or air hole.
These rooms were occupied in the hot month of
July by a colored female, having pulmonary
consumption, and her two children. Here she
died, shortly after we made the inspection of
her domicilium; having no money nor friends,
a Christian burial was denied her for four days,
although the neighbors acquainted the police of
the fact, and they the Health Warden.”</p>

<p class="section r"><span class="dc">“Rag</span> Pickers Row” is thus described:
“The houses are of wood, two stories,
with attic and basement. The attic rooms
are used to deposit the filthy rags and bones as
they are taken from gutters and slaughter-houses.
The yards are filled with

<span class="sni">Rag Pickers<br>
Row</span>

dirty rags hung up to dry, sending
forth their stench to all the
neighborhood, and are exceedingly
nauseous, operating upon me as an emetic.
The tenants are all Germans of the lowest order,
having no national nor personal pride; they are
exceedingly filthy in person, and their bed-clothes
are as dirty as the floors they walk on;
their food is of the poorest quality, and their
feet and heads, and doubtless their whole
bodies, are anasarcous, suffering from what they
call rheumatism, but which is in reality a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
prostrate nervous system, the result of foul air
and inadequate supply of nutritious food.
They have a peculiar taste for the association
of dogs and cats, there being about 50 of the
former and 30 of the latter. The whole number
of apartments is 32, occupied by 28 families,
number 120 in all, 60 adults and 60 children.
The yards are all small, and the sinks running
over with filth.”</p>

<p class="section s"><span class="dc">Says</span> a visitor in the Eighth Ward: “The instances
are many in which one or more families,
of from three to seven or more members,
of all ages and both sexes, are congregated
in a single and often contracted apartment.
Here they eat, drink,

<span class="sni">Tenant-House<br>
Degeneration</span>

sleep, work, dress and undress,
without the possibility of that
privacy which an innate modesty
imperatively demands. In sickness and in
health it is the same.</p>

<p>“What is the consequence? The sense of
shame—the greatest, surest safeguard of virtue,
except the grace of God—is gradually
blunted, ruined, and finally destroyed. New
scenes are witnessed and participated in, with
a countenance of brass, the very thought of
which, once, would have filled the sensitive
heart of modesty with pain, and covered its cheek
with burning blushes. The mind of one thus
brought in daily and nightly contact with such
scenes must become greatly debased, and its
fall, before the assaults of vice, rendered almost
certain.”</p>

Another writes: “These houses seem to be
always open to newcomers, and, in some way
or other, they can accommodate them. I have
found three families, of men, women, and children,
in one room; there they lived and there
they slept. Can any one doubt that there must
be a rapid declension of morals in both parents
and children, or that a bar is here opposed to
moral and religious instruction, or that this
state of things is consequent on the circumstances
and condition of life?”</p>

<p>I could give you many details of other tenant-houses,
the reputation of which is a reproach
to any city in the civilized world. Such is
“Gotham Court,” “Rotten Row,” “The Great
Eastern,” “Sebastopol,” “Quality Row,” “Bummer’s
Retreat,” etc. Speaking of the tenant-house,
the Rev. Dr. Muhlenburg says:</p>

<p>“‘Their homes!’ that cold and damp cellar,
about as tenantable as your coal vault! Do you
call that a home for the distressed body,
crowded in one corner there, swollen with the
pains of rheumatism? Or that close apartment,
heated or stifling in preparing the evening meal,
on the shattered stove—that suffocating room,
where you would not stop within for a moment—is
that the home which you think so favorable
for the worn asthmatic, catching every
breath as if the last? Ask any clergyman, he
will tell you with how little satisfaction he
makes his visits among the poor, when they are
laboring among disease; how he never has the
heart to speak of comfort for the soul, when
discomforts of the body call so loudly for relief,
and for which the scanty aid he can minister
seems akin to mockery!”</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Mr.</span> N.&nbsp;P. Willis who witnessed the “draft”
riots thus truthfully and graphically describes
the inmates of tenant-houses:</p>

<p>“The high brick blocks and closely packed
houses where the mobs originated, seemed to
be literally hives of sickness and vice.

<span class="sni">The<br>
Rioters</span>

It was wonderful to see, and difficult to
believe, that so much misery, disease
and wretchedness can be huddled together
and hidden by high walls, unvisited and
unthought of, so near our own abodes. Lewd,
but pale and sickly young women, scarce decent
in their ragged attire, were impudent and scattered
everywhere in the crowd. But what numbers
of these poorer classes are deformed—what
numbers are made hideous by self-neglect
and infirmity! Alas! human faces look so
hideous with hope and self-respect all gone!
And female forms and features are made so
frightful by sin, squalor, and debasement! To
walk the streets as we walked them, in those
hours of conflagration and riot, was like witnessing
the day of judgment, with every wicked
thing revealed, every sin and sorrow blazingly
glared upon, every hidden abomination laid bare
before hell’s expectant fire? The elements of
popular discord are gathered in these wretchedly
constructed tenement houses, where poverty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
disease, and crime find an abode. Here
disease in its most loathsome forms propagates
itself. Unholy passions rule in the domestic
circle. Everything, within and without, tends
to physical and moral degradation.”</p>

<p class="section s"><span class="dc">Such,</span> Mr. Chairman, is the external and internal
sanitary condition of the homes of
500,000 people in the City of New York to-day,
as revealed by this inspection. It requires
no extraordinary amount of medical knowledge
to determine the physical condition

<span class="sni">Tenant-House<br>
Rot</span>

of this immense population,
living under such circumstances.
Even though no devastating
epidemic is found ravaging the tenant-house,
yet the first sight of the wretched inmates convinces
you that diseases far more destructive to
health and happiness, because creating no
alarm, are wasting the vital energies, and slowly
but surely consuming the very tissues of the
body.</p>

<p>Here infantile life unfolds its bud, but perishes
before its first anniversary. Here youth
is ugly with loathsome diseases and the deformities
which follow physical degeneracy.
Here the decrepitude of old age is found at
thirty. The poor themselves have a very expressive
term for the slow process of decay
which they suffer, viz.: “Tenant-house Rot.”
The great majority are, indeed, undergoing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
slow decomposition—a true eremacausis, as
the chemists term it. And with this physical
degeneration we find mental and moral deterioration.
The frequent expression of the
poor, “We have no sickness, thank God,” is
uttered by those whose sunken eyes, pale
cheeks, and colorless lips speak more eloquently
than words, of the unseen agencies which are
sapping the fountains of health. Vice, crime,
drunkenness, lust, disease, and death, here hold
sway, in spite of the most powerful moral and
religious influences.</p>

<p>Religious teachers and Bible readers are beginning
to give this class over as past all
remedy, until their physical condition is improved.
Their intellects are so blunted and
their perceptions so perverted by the noxious
atmosphere which they breathe, and the all-pervading
filth in which they live, move, and
have their being, that they are not susceptible
to moral or religious influences. In London,
some of the city missionaries have entirely
abandoned the tenant-house class. There is, undoubtedly,
a depraved physical condition which
explains the moral deterioration of these people,
and which can never be overcome until we
surround them with the conditions of sound
health. A child growing up in this pestilential
atmosphere becomes vicious and brutal, not
from any natural depravity, but because it is
mentally incapable of the perceptions of truth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Most truly does the Inspector of the Fourth
Ward say:</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">“There</span> is a tenant-house cachexy well-known

practical acquaintance with these abodes;
nor does it affect alone the physical condition
of their inmates. It has its moral prototype in

<span class="sni">Tenant-House<br>
Cachexy</span>

depravity, to whose
malign influence the youthful
survivors of the terrible physical
evils to which their infancy is exposed, are
sure to succumb. We often find in persons of
less than middle age, who have long occupied
such confined and filthy premises, a morbid condition
of the system unknown elsewhere. The
eye becomes bleared, the senses blunted, the
limbs shrunken and tremulous, the secretions
exceedingly offensive. There is a state of premature
decay.</p>

<p>“In this condition of life the ties of nature
seem to be unloosed. Maternal instinct and filial
affection seem to participate in the general decay
of soul and body. A kind Providence, whose
hand is visible even here, mercifully provides
that the almost inevitable decay and death
which man’s criminal neglect entails on the offspring
of the unfortunate who dwell in these
dreary mansions, shall elicit comparatively
feeble pangs of parental anguish. To the physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
and moral degradation, the blight of these
miserable abodes, where decay reigns supreme
over habitation and inhabitant alike, may be
plainly traced much of the immorality and
crime which prevail among us. The established
truth, that, as the corporeal frame deteriorates,
man’s spiritual nature is liable also to degenerate,
receives its apt illustration here.”</p>

<p class="section b"><span class="dc">But,</span> sir, acute diseases, and those frequently
of the most destructive character, prevail at
all seasons among the tenant-house population,
and generally with fearful fatality. Although
the last summer and autumn were unusually
healthy, these records show

<span class="sni">Prevailing<br>
Diseases</span>

the prevalence of a vast amount
of diseases among the poor of New
York. These diseases are of a
kind that always originate in or are aggravated
by the crowding of families in unventilated
apartments, want of sunlight and pure air, house
and street filth, etc.</p>

<p>First Ward: The diseases prevalent in this
district the past season have been principally
typhus, measles, diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera
morbus, cholera infantum, and marasmus.
Diarrhoeal diseases are most prevalent in those
insalubrious quarters already described, and at
a season when the exciting causes are at their
greatest stage of development and activity.</p>

<p>Second and Third Wards: Typhus fever made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
its appearance in tenant-houses, and in two or
three instances spread through all the families
immediately exposed. At one place the disease
attacked successively every member of the family
immediately exposed, but was prevented
from spreading further by free ventilation.</p>

<p>Fifth Ward: The slips, in consequence of receiving
the sewerage of the district and surrounding
parts of the city, are generally foul
and the undoubted source of much sickness.
Smallpox has prevailed more extensively than
for many years back. Typhus and typhoid fevers
have been prevalent over the whole district.</p>

<p>Eighth Ward: The prevailing diseases of the
past season have been fevers of the typhus,
typhoid, remittent and intermittent types, cholera
infantum, scarlatina, dysentery, and diarrhoea,
all confined to densely populated tenements.
The typhus and typhoid fevers have
been of a malignant type in two houses, twelve
out of eighteen cases proving fatal.</p>

<p>Ninth Ward: The prevailing diseases during
the past season have been typhoid fever, dysentery,
diarrhoea, scarlet fever, measles, and a
few cases of variola.</p>

<p class="section s"><span class="dc">Sixth</span> Ward: The seeds of disease exist
everywhere, and although removable and
susceptible of sanitary control, they are yet
uncontrolled, and at any time may spring into

<span class="sni">Seeds of Disease<br>
Uncontrolled</span>

activity and a terrific life, that shall only have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
the power and effect of death. Cholera, when
it visits these shores again,
will first break forth
here, if proper sanitary
measures be neglected. Typhus
fever nests exist in all parts of the district;
and it has been traced from these nests to every
ward in the city, spreading the disease not only
in the worst localities, but into the homes of the
industrious, the wealthy, and the highest classes
of society. This disease is now on the increase,
and if proper sanitary measures are not adopted
to remove the predisposing and the infecting
causes, we may again have an epidemic of that
scourge.</p>

<p>Fourteenth Ward: There have been attended
in this district, during the last year, over 200
cases of typhoid and typhus fever by one dispensary
physician; also, 70 cases of dysentery, and
50 cases of smallpox. There is one particular
locality which has contributed to the spread
and intensity of the fever contagion, viz.: the
little street known as Jersey Street. It is always
filthy, and the effluvia arising therefrom is extremely
offensive. The privies are generally
full nearly to overflowing, and the yards are
also in a dirty condition, heaps of refuse matter
being allowed to remain and to accumulate continually
in many of them. There is no sewer
in this little street, though the streets at each
end are sewered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Tenth</span> Ward: The most prominent diseases
during the past year have been
phthisis, typhoid and scarlet fevers, cholera
infantum, dysentery, smallpox, and diphtheria.
They were most prevalent in the poorest
part of the district, having the

<span class="sni">Where Disease<br>
Flourishes</span>

lowest ground, the filthiest
streets, and the most dense
population of poor and careless
people, who are crowded in the numerous
tenant-houses, shanties, and small dwellings,
which were built for one or two families, but
are now made to contain from five to ten.</p>

<p>Nineteenth Ward: The diseases that have
chiefly prevailed during the past season are dysentery,
diarrhoea, cholera morbus, cholera infantum
and the exanthematous fevers. They
were of the most frequent occurrence in the
most crowded and insalubrious quarters.</p>

<p>Fifteenth Ward: Since the commencement of
the survey, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, smallpox,
and cholera infantum have prevailed in
the tenant-houses of this ward. Six cases of
smallpox occurred in one of three thickly peopled
rows of such dwellings, and the disease
was communicated to a child in an adjacent
street, who had been playing in the infected
neighborhood. Seven cases of typhoid also occurred
in a court among children, and this was
within a few doors of better class houses.</p>

<p>Eleventh Ward: Typhus and typhoid fevers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
have been found prevailing in all sections of this
district. Smallpox, scarlatina, measles, and
pulmonary diseases are met with in almost
every street. Typhus is the most typical of the
preventable diseases that abound in the
Eleventh Ward. Cholera infantum and obstinate
diarrhoeal maladies were prevalent in
the rear tenements and throughout the lowest
streets during the summer and autumn.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of the wide prevalence of
these diseases, I will notice one or two more in
detail.</p>

<p class="section s"><span class="dc">Smallpox</span> is the very type of preventable
diseases. We have a safe and sure preventive
in thorough vaccination. And yet this
loathsome disease is at this moment an epidemic
in New York. In two days’ time, the inspectors
found 644 cases, and in two weeks,

<span class="sni">Smallpox</span>

upward of 1,200; and it was estimated
that only about one-half
were discovered. In many large tenant-houses,
six, eight, and ten cases were found at the same
time. They found it under every conceivable
condition tending to promote its communicability.
It was in the street cars, in the stages, in
the hacks, on the ferry-boats, in junk-shops, in
cigar-stores, in candy-shops, in the families of
tailors and seamstresses, who were making
clothing for wholesale stores, in public and
in private charities. I hold in my hand a list<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
of cases of smallpox found existing under circumstances
which show how widespread is this
disease. Bedding of a fatal case of smallpox
was sold to a rag-man; case in a room where
candy and daily papers were sold; case on a
ferry-boat; woman was attending bar and acting
as nurse to her husband who had smallpox;
girl who was making cigars while scabs were falling
from her skin; seamstress who was making shirts
for a Broadway store, one of which was thrown
over the cradle of a child sick of smallpox; tailors
making soldiers’ clothing, have their children,
from whom the scabs were falling,
wrapped in the garments; a woman selling
vegetables had the scabs falling from her face,
among the vegetables, etc., etc. Instances of
this kind can be quoted at any length, but these
examples are sufficient to show that smallpox
spreads uncontrolled throughout our city. And
they show, too, how this disease is disseminated
abroad. Says the Inspector of the Fourth
Ward:</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">“In</span> localities where smallpox prevailed I
found, in some instances within a few feet
of the patients, tailors at work for our best
clothing establishments. Such infected vestments—worse
than the tunic of the Centaur—bring

<span class="sni">Smallpox in Tailored<br>
Garments</span>

disease and death not only to the wearers,
but to many others. The occupant of the
crowded tenant-house procures from such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
source a coat or a blanket, and soon a loathsome
pest attacks the
young and unprotected
members of his family,
and ultimately spreads
through the entire quarter, destroying life after
life and endangering the health of a whole community.</p>

<p>“Smallpox, suddenly breaking out in some
secluded rural district, often owes its unsuspected
origin to the above causes. In the
remote solitude of the ocean the seaman opens
the chest in which he has deposited such obnoxious
apparel, and from this Pandora’s box
scatters the seeds of pestilence among his comrades,
which, ripening, shall spread its germs
to distant ports.”</p>

<p>Or, what is more striking, take the following
from the report of the Inspector of the Fifth
Ward:</p>

<p>“The largest wholesale establishments for the
sale of dry goods on this side of the Atlantic
Ocean are in immediate contact with the tenant-houses
of the worst class, and which are infested
with smallpox and typhus fever. The two
freight depots and the principal passenger depot
of the Railroad Company are in the same close
association with these nests of infection. In the
region immediately surrounding are also situated
several hotels, and a large number of
boarding-houses, whose inmates are thus in danger
of personal contact with these diseases any
moment. West Broadway, running through the
very centre of the district, is traversed by five
different lines of railway cars, with an average
of five cars passing every minute, and carrying
millions of passengers yearly by the very doors
of these houses. Broadway, at but a short distance
removed, is the principal thoroughfare of
the city. Hudson Street on the west is also a
leading route for city travel; and the cross
streets of the district are traversed daily by multitudes
to reach various lines of steamboats,
cars, and steamships, which leave the city opposite
this point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<div id="ip_111" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21.125em;">

  <div class="caption">A REGION OF SMALLPOX AND TYPHUS FEVER, 1865</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
“All this large amount of daily travel passes
through a region always containing cases of
typhus fever, and largely infected with smallpox.
Is it any cause of surprise that cases of
these diseases are here contracted, to be carried
to distant sections of the country, there to develop
themselves, to the surprise and alarm of
whole neighborhoods? It is also well to remember
that several large livery stables are located
in the immediate neighborhood, whose vehicles,
it is well-known, are frequently employed to
carry persons, suffering from these diseases, to
hospitals, or to attend at funerals. These vehicles
are, perhaps, immediately afterward
driven to the various car and steamboat lines
to secure passengers, who are thus exposed in
the most dangerous manner to these diseases.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p class="section s"><span class="dc">Second</span> only to smallpox as a preventable
disease, but of a more fatal character, is
typhus fever. Typhus is greatly aggravated
by domestic filth, and by overcrowding,
with deficient ventilation. The inspectors
found and located by street and number

<span class="sni">Typhus<br>
Fever</span>

no less than 2,000 cases of this
most contagious and fatal disease.
Commencing in a large tenant-house
in Mulberry Street, it was traced from locality
to locality, in the poorer quarters, until it was
found to have visited nearly every section of
the city. It became localized in many tenant-houses
and streets, where it still remains, causing
a large amount of sickness and mortality.</p>

<p>At Mulberry Street, in a notoriously filthy
house, it has existed for more than four years.
This house has a population of about 320, which
is renewed every few months. During the period
alluded to, there have been no less than 60
deaths by fever in this single house, and 240
cases. To-day this fever is raging uncontrolled
in that house, creating more orphans than
many well-fought battles. Every new family
which enters these infected quarters is sure to
fall a victim to this pestilential disease.</p>

<p><i>Here 85 Cases of Typhus Occurred in
One Season</i></p></div></div>

<p>The tenant-house No. — East Seventeenth
Street, which reaks with filth, gives the same
history; upward of 85 cases, with a large percentage
of deaths, occurred in this single house
during the past season. And still it remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
unclean and open to new tenants. I could mention
scores of these houses in every part of the
tenant-house district where typhus has apparently
taken
up its abode, and
from whence it
sends out in every
direction its
deadly streams.</p>

<p>Not only have
single houses become
centres of
contagion, but
this fever has, in
many instances,
become localized
in crowded
streets, which to-day
are almost
impassable on
account of the
heaps of garbage,
and the
courts and alleys
of which are
reeking with
filth, making
them great centres
of pestilence.
From many of these tenements whole
families have been swept away.</p>

  <div class="caption">BIRD’S-EYE VIEW OF FEVER-NEST, 1865, NOT FAR
FROM BROADWAY AND FIFTH AVENUE</div></div>

<p>Jersey Street, a short but uncleaned avenue,
adjacent to a fashionable part of Broadway, is
another great depot of fever, which, according
to these records, frequently contained upward
of thirty cases in progress at one time. East
Eleventh Street, between First and Second
Avenues, now, as all the past summer, in a horribly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
filthy condition, is a local habitation of fever
of the worst type. The same statement may
be made of nearly every district where the
tenant-houses are especially crowded, and the
streets, courts, and alleys are unusually filthy.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Intestinal</span> diseases, as cholera infantum,
diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid fever, etc.,
which arise from, or are intensely aggravated
by the emanations from putrescible material
in streets, courts, and alleys, or from cesspools,
privies, drain pipes, sewers,

<span class="sni">Intestinal<br>
Affections</span>

etc., were prevalent in the tenant-house
districts, creating, as usual,
a vast amount of sickness, and a
large infant mortality. Very generally these
diseases were directly traceable to the decomposing
filth, and in some instances were stopped
by the removal of the nuisance.</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Eighth Ward reports:
“Cholera infantum has probably consigned
many more to the grave during the past summer
than all other diseases in my inspection
district. In every case examined I have found
it associated with some well-marked course of
insalubrity; vegetable and animal decomposition
have been the most prominent causes. That
fifty per cent die from preventable causes in
my inspection district I do not doubt.”</p>

<p>The Inspector of the Sixth Ward says: “The
mortality among children is fearfully high,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
many families having lost all their children;
others four out of five or six.”</p>

<div id="ip_117" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.8125em;">
  <img src="books/1_files/i_117.jpg" width="381" height="304" alt="">
  <div class="caption">PLAN OF MONROE STREET FEVER-NEST, 1865</div></div>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> Inspector of the Ninth Ward says he
found among the people living near the
mouth of an open sewer: “That no less than
twenty-nine cases of dysentery and diarrhoea,

<span class="sni">Living at a<br>
Sewer’s Mouth</span>

five of which had terminated fatally, had occurred
during the three weeks
immediately preceding his inspection.”
He adds: “Now,
when we take into consideration
the fact that there are only twenty-two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
dwellings on this square (a considerable portion
of it being occupied by a large lumber-yard),
and that all these cases had occurred
within a period of about twenty-one days, the
ratio becomes appalling. How many cases
may have occurred subsequently, I have not
sought to ascertain, my time being fully occupied
in the inspection of the other parts of my
district. But a still more direct and specific action
of the poisonous emanations proceeding
from this obstructed sewerage, manifested itself
in the dwelling on the corner of West and
Gansevoort streets, which is in the closest
proximity to the outlet of the sewer. Here I
learned, upon inquiry, that typhoid fever had
prevailed almost continuously during the preceding
winter, and I found three severe cases of
dysentery at the time of my visit.”</p>

<p>But I will not occupy time with further details
of the evidence which this inspection furnishes
of the vast accumulation of the causes of
unhealthiness which exist in New York, and of
the wide prevalence of contagious diseases
arising therefrom or aggravated thereby.</p>

<p>The next point of inquiry is as to the effect
of these conditions upon the public health of
the city. Our constituted health authorities
claim that notwithstanding this excessive concentration
of the causes of disease around and
in the homes of half of our population, the
death-rate of New York is very low. To properly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
understand this statement, we must inquire
what is the rate of death from inevitable causes.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">It</span> has been estimated by careful writers on
vital statistics that 17 in 1,000 living persons
annually die from inevitable causes. That is,
in a community of 1,000 persons living under
circumstances such that persons die only from

<span class="sni">The Normal<br>
Death-Rate</span>

old age, cancer, casualties, etc.,
17 will die annually, and no
more. And this number is the
maximum that will die without
the occurrence of some disease due to a removable
cause. Taking this standard as the absolute
necessary death-rate, we can readily estimate
the number of unnecessary or preventable
deaths which occur in any community.</p>

<p>Says the Registrar-General of England
(Twentieth Annual Report): “Any deaths in a
people exceeding 17 in 1,000 annually are unnatural
deaths. If the people were shot,
drowned, burnt, poisoned by strychnine, their
deaths would not be more unnatural than the
deaths wrought clandestinely by diseases in excess
of the quota of natural death—that is, in
excess of seventeen in 1,000 living.”</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Taking</span> this as the standard, let us see how
the death-rate of New York compares with
it. It is claimed by the city officials that notwithstanding
the vast accumulation of the universally-recognized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>

<span class="sni">Death-Rate of<br>
New York</span>

causes of disease, New York
has a low death-rate. It is not
reasonable to suppose this
statement true, nor is it true, as
will presently appear. It is
stated very truly in the City Inspector’s Report
for 1863, that “it is only by taking a connected
view of a period of years that a correct judgment
can be formed of the state of health of a
city,” and upon this basis let us determine what
is the mortality of New York.</p>

<p>Take the 11 years preceding the last census,
viz., 1860, excluding, however, 1854, the year of
the cholera. I select this period because it includes
the three last census returns, and it is
only where we have the census returns with the
mortality records that we have accurate data for
our estimates. Now, the City Inspector’s own
records (reports of 1863, page 192) show that
during the period referred to, the death-rate of
New York City was never below 28 in the 1,000,
and twice exceeded 40 in the 1,000, the average
being as high as 33 in the 1,000. These deductions
are made directly from the City Inspector’s
Reports, and, as they are claimed to be infallible,
these conclusions cannot be controverted.</p>

<p>Now, when you remember that the highest
death-rate fixed by sanitary writers for inevitable
deaths is 17 in 1,000, and that all deaths
above that standard are considered preventable,
it is apparent what a fearful sacrifice of life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
there is in New York. Estimated at the very
minimum death-rate of the last decennial period,
viz.: 28 in 1,000, New York annually lost
11 from preventable deaths in 1,000 of her population,
or upwards of 7,000 yearly, on an average,
giving the enormous sum total for this
period of 77,000 preventable deaths.</p>

<p>It may be urged that cities never can attain
to this standard of healthfulness, but English
writers maintain that the rate of 17 in the 1,000
is the true measure of the public health, and
that even the most populous towns may yet be
brought up to it. Nor can we doubt that there
is much plausibility in the assertion, when we
find the mortality in Philadelphia fall to 18 in
1,000, and that of London gradually descend
from 30 in 1,000 to 22 in 1,000.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">It</span> is maintained, also, that New York has a
lower death-rate than London or Philadelphia.
Let us see how far this assertion is
sustained by the records of the health authorities
of those cities. During the decennial period
preceding, but including

<span class="sni">New York, London, and<br>
Liverpool Compared</span>

1860, and excluding
1854, as in the
former comparison,
the minimum mortality in London was 20 in
1,000, the maximum 24 in 1,000, the mean
about 22 in 1,000. These figures are from the
Registrar-General Reports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
The rate of mortality of Philadelphia for the
same period was as follows: Minimum 18 in
1,000, maximum 23 in 1,000, mean about 20 in
1,000. These figures are from the report of Dr.
Jewell, long the able Health Officer of that city.
Placed in their proper relation, these mortality
statistics read as follows: The number of deaths
to the 1,000 living for the ten years, 1850–60
inclusive, but exclusive of 1854, is for</p>

<table class="p1 b1" summary="Philadelphia Mortality Rate">

</tbody></table>

<p>If, then, New York had as low an average
death-rate as Philadelphia, she would have
saved 13 in 1,000 of her population during that
period, or in 1860, 10,577. These figures may
seem excessive, but they are careful deductions
from the annual returns of the several cities.
And yet it is reiterated year after year by the
City Inspector, that “New York City, at this day,
can lay claim to the privilege of being numbered
with the most healthy in the world.”</p>

<p>With what consummate justice did Dr. Jewell
administer this withering rebuke to our pretentious
official. “It is unnecessary,” he says, in
his report of 1860, “to comment upon this extraordinary
statement, when the above figures
contradict so positively the assertion. It is to be
regretted that the inspector had not availed himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
of the above statistical information, which
would have obliged him to have presented a
widely different statement, although one indicating
a more severe pressure of sanitary
evils, upon the health of their population, than
his report develops.”</p>

<p class="section b"><span class="dc">But</span> excessive as is this death-rate, it is not
the full measure of the penalty which we
pay to the demon of filth. A high death-rate
from the diseases which it engenders or intensifies,
always implies a large amount of sickness.
It is estimated by competent

<span class="sni">Constant<br>
Sickness</span>

authority that there are 28 cases of
sickness for every death. On this
basis of estimate what an enormous
amount of unnecessary sickness exists in our
midst! Nor is this a mere supposition. I have
an accurate census of many groups of families
of that portion of our population who live immured
in filth, and here we find the constant
sickness-rate excessive. It is no uncommon
thing to find it 50, 60, and 70 per cent.</p>

<p class="section i"><span class="dc">I</span> wish now to call your attention to the fact
that great as is our mortality and sickness
rate, its excess is not equally distributed over
the entire population, but falls exclusively upon
the poor and helpless. One-half, at least, of

<span class="sni">Where the Death Pressure<br>
Is Greatest</span>

the population of New York have a death-rate
no higher than the people of a healthy country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
town, while the death pressure upon the other
half is frightfully
severe. For example,
the Seventeenth
Ward,
which is inhabited principally by the wealthy
class and has but few tenant-houses, has a death-rate
of but 17 in 1,000, or only the death-rate
from inevitable causes; but the Sixth and
Fourth Wards, which are occupied by the laboring
classes, have a death-rate varying from
36 to 40 in 1,000.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that while the average death-rate
of the city is very high, it is principally
sustained by those Wards where the tenant-house
population is the most numerous. We
find this excess of mortality just where we found
the causes of diseases existing most numerously.
And when we sift the matter further, we find
that the excess of mortality is not even equally
distributed over these populous poor Wards, but
is concentrated upon individual tenant-houses.
For example, while the mortality of the Sixth
Ward is nearly 40 in 1,000, the mortality of its
large tenant-houses is as high as 60 to 70 in
1,000. The following is a recent census of a
large but not exceptional tenant-house of that
Ward: Number of families in the house, 74;
persons, 349; deaths, 18, or 53 in 1,000; constant
sickness, 1 in 3; deaths of children, 1 in 6, or at
the rate of 16 in 1,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
The following table illustrates the distribution
of the mortality of New York among the different
classes of inhabitants at the last census:</p>

<p class="section b"><span class="dc">But</span> I should not do justice to this branch of
inquiry without noticing the alleged causes
of the high mortality of New York. The
first is the large foreign immigration. The reliance
to be placed upon that scapegoat may be
readily shown. Emigration

<span class="sni">Some Scapegoats—<br>Foreign<br>
Immigration</span>

occurs to this
country under two conditions:
1. The emigrant
is driven from home by famine, in which case
the poorer class emigrate, or, 2, he is allured by
advantages for labor or business, when the
middle classes principally emigrate.</p>

<p>Now, it is under the latter circumstances
that emigration generally takes place to the
United States. This is seen in the vast sums of
money which the emigrants now annually bring,
and the amounts which they return to their
friends as the result of their labor. This class
is always very hardy and healthy, as is proved
by the small mortality that occurs <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in transitu</i>
being but 4.31 per cent for ten years. Besides,
we have the official statements of the Commissioners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
of Emigration that but 3 per cent remain
in the city.</p>

<div id="ip_126" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23.375em;">
  <img src="books/1_files/i_126.jpg" width="374" height="238" alt="">
  <div class="caption">A SIXTH WARD FEVER-NEST WITH DEATH-RATE
OF 53 IN 1,000</div></div>

<p>But the City Inspector himself shows the utter
fallacy of this alleged cause of excessive mortality
in his report for 1860, in which he makes
the true explanation, and attributes to its proper
cause whatever increased mortality arises from
emigrants. He says:</p>

<p>“Most of the children who arrive in this city
from foreign ports, although suffering from the
effects of a protracted voyage, bad accommodations,
and worse fare, do not bring with them
any marked disease beyond those which, with
proper care, nursing, and wholesome air, could
not be easily overcome. The causes of this excessive
mortality must be searched for in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
city, and are readily traceable to the wretched
habitations in which parents and children are
forced to take up their abode; in the contracted
alleys, the tenement house, with its hundreds of
occupants, where each cooks, eats, and sleeps in
a single room, without light or ventilation, surrounded
with filth, an atmosphere foul, fetid,
and deadly, with none to console with or advise
them, or to apply to for relief when disease
invades them.”</p>

<p class="section al"><span class="dc">Again,</span> it is alleged that the floating population
causes the excess of deaths. But it
has been established by Dr. Playfair that
the floating population is the most healthy.
The same is true of wandering tribes, of a moving
army, and equally of individuals.

<span class="sni">The Floating<br>
Population</span>

But when they fix
their habitations or encamp,
that moment the causes of disease
begin to gather about them, and unless sanitary
regulations are carefully observed, diseases,
such as fever, diarrhoeal affections, etc.,
begin to prevail.</p>

<p>The poor population of New York is to-day
but an immense army in camp, upon small
territory, crowded into old filthy dwellings, and
without the slightest police regulation for cleanliness.
If this army should abandon its camp
and begin a roving life in the country, all the
diseases now prevalent would disappear. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
it must be added, that if these deserted and uncleaned
tenements should immediately be filled
by healthy people from the country, the new
tenants would at once begin to suffer from all
the pestilential diseases now indigenous to that
part of the city.</p>

<p>I have now laid before you, as briefly as possible,
the accumulated evidence that New York
is to-day full to repletion with all the causes
which originate and intensify the most loathsome
and fatal diseases known to mankind.</p>

<p>This evidence proves that at least half a million
of its population are literally submerged
in filth, and half-stifled in an atmosphere
charged with all the elements of death. I have
demonstrated that the legitimate fruits of her
sanitary evils is an excessively high death-rate
and a correspondingly large sickness rate.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> all-important question which now concerns
us as citizens, and you as practical
legislators, is, can these evils be remedied?
We answer, yes. In the first place the
streets can be kept clean. Other cities
accomplish this
object, and therefore

<span class="sni">Can the Causes of Disease<br>
Be Removed?</span>

New York can,
and we have striking
illustrative examples. In certain portions
of the city the streets are as clean as this
floor. They are swept daily, and scarcely a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
particle of dust is left in the streets or gutters
the year round. But they are cleaned by private
contract of the people residing upon them.
What individual enterprise can do for whole
squares, surely a corporation so lavish in
money as New York ought to be able to do for
the city at large.</p>

<p>The courts, alleys, cesspools, and privies can
be cleansed and kept in good condition. There
are tenant-houses which are as clean in all their
alleys, courts, and cellars as the best-kept private
houses. These are dwellings for the poor
in which the landlord takes especial interest.
What is done for the surroundings of one of
these houses, may be done for all. But the
tenant-houses of the worst class may be quickly
placed in a good sanitary condition.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> inspectors furnish many examples of this
fact. They were frequently mistaken in
their inspection for an official, and when
their visit to the tenant-houses was reported to
the landlord, he hastened to renovate the building.
Some of the most

<span class="sni">Improvements During<br>
the Inspection</span>

filthy quarters were so
completely changed
within forty-eight
hours that the inspectors could scarcely recognize
the locality. The Inspector of the Eighth
Ward says:</p>

<p>“The sanitary improvement in my district<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
during the progress of my inspection was
plainly visible. Exceedingly filthy places, overflowing
cesspools, and privies, which were
numerous in my first visit, were suddenly
cleaned. Often upon my second visit, with paper
and pencil
in my hand to
sketch the filthy
scene, I would
find the quarters
cleaned and
whitewashed,
and the air, instead
of being
laden with disagreeable
odors,
would be comparatively
pure
and wholesome.
Many of these
sudden transitions
were from
fear of the presumption
that
my inspection
had some official
authority; but
the greater part were brought about by explaining
to the people the necessity of cleanliness.</p>

<div id="ip_130" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 14.875em;">

  <div class="caption">PLAN OF A TYPICAL FEVER-NEST,

<p>“Pools of filthy water from obstructions at the
street corners, and accumulated along the gutters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
would quickly disappear, when the people
would be convinced of the deleterious effect
upon the public health. It will be well for the
inhabitants of New York City, and especially
for those of this section, when there shall be
laws not only to compel them to keep their
houses and surroundings clean and free from
the effluvia resulting from vegetable and animal
decomposition, but to prevent the overcrowding
of tenant-houses, where fatal diseases are
generated, and where death walks around.”</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> tenant-house population is susceptible of
infinite improvement, when once rescued
from the reign of filth, and restored to a
pure atmosphere and clean homes. The poor
live in these wretched tenements because they
are compelled to, and not

<span class="sni">How to Improve<br>
the People</span>

from choice. They universally
complain that they
cannot escape from domestic
and street filth. It surrounds and pervades
their habitations, always accumulating, and
never diminishing. The most tidy house-wife,
compelled to live in the midst of this ocean of
rubbish, with all its degrading associations, soon
finds the same level, and from this she can be
rescued only by giving her again a clean and
well-ordered home. And such a home every
municipal government is bound to secure to the
poorest and humblest citizen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
Let the landlord be compelled to keep his
house in good repair, supply it with an abundance
of pure water, connect the privy with the
sewer, open free ventilation, afford means for
removal of garbage, and then keep a careful
oversight of his tenants, enforcing cleanliness.
If this were done, the tenant-house people
would immediately improve, and the death-rate,
if we may judge from other cities, would fall
one-fourth.</p>

<p>Again, the cellar population can be removed
from their subterranean abodes, and placed in
better homes. Liverpool has solved this problem
for us.</p>

<p>In 1847 that city had a cellar population
of 20,000; an ordinance was passed forbidding
the occupation of underground rooms
as residences, with certain restrictions, and
within three years the great mass of people in
these subterranean haunts were removed to
better tenements, with a great reduction of the
mortality of the city.</p>

<p>That city, formerly the most unhealthy in
England, has continued the reforms thus inaugurated
by compelling landlords to improve
their tenant-houses, and the result is that it has
become one of the healthiest towns of Europe.
London has recently taken similar action in regard
to cellar tenements. What these cities
have done, New York can and ought to do for
her public health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">What</span> the diseases which prevail with such
fatality in the uncleaned tenant-houses are
for the most part preventable, we have the
most undoubted evidence. That smallpox is
preventable is known to every school-boy, and
yet that loathsome disease to-day

<span class="sni">A Town That<br>
Was Immune</span>

prevails throughout all the
tenant-house districts of New
York, without the slightest restraint
on the part of our local authorities. Typhus
is to-day ravaging the homes of the poor
without “let or hindrance,” and yet cleanliness
and pure air are sure preventives. Of this truth
these reports furnish many examples.</p>

<p>The fever-nest—West Thirty-third Street—is
one of a row of tenant-houses five stories high,
and contains 16 families. It was in a filthy condition,
without Croton water, waste-pipes
stopped, sinks overflowing and emitting offensive
odors; fever had prevailed all winter,
nearly every person in the house having had
an attack, four having died. It was never inspected
by a city official. The owner was induced
to clean the house, and from that date
not a case of fever has occurred. The inspector
who reports this case very justly adds: “If,
when the first case of fever occurred in this
building, the owner had been compelled to put
it in a good sanitary condition, six human lives
would undoubtedly have been saved, besides a
great amount of sickness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

  <div class="caption">PLAN OF A REAR CUL-DE-SAC FEVER-NEST, 1865</div></div>

<p>Cholera infantum and diarrhoeal affections
are found in their greatest intensity where
putrescible animal matter and domestic filth
exist. Remove these causes, or remove the patients
from the neighborhood, and these diseases
generally disappear at once. Diphtheria
is found to be most intense in the vicinity of
unclean stables. It is, therefore, with great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
propriety, that the entire class of zymotic diseases
are now called “filth and foul air” diseases
by the English sanitary writers. Remove
the filth and foul air, and these diseases disappear
as effect follows cause.</p>

<p class="section b"><span class="dc">But</span> while it is admitted that the streets of a
town may be cleaned, the condition of the
poor improved, and diseases, under the
most favorable circumstances, prevented, it may
be doubted whether the sanitary condition of
populous towns can be

<span class="sni">Can Populous Towns<br>
Be Improved?</span>

materially changed, and
the death-rate greatly
reduced. Yet in England,
where sanitary science is enthusiastically
cultivated, there is not only no doubt that large
towns can be thus improved, but that the mortality
of London itself may be no greater than
that of the country.</p>

<p>Already, indeed, the London <i>Times</i> boasts
“that the average of health throughout the City
of London is higher than the average of health
throughout all England, taking town and country
together. The mortality in all England is
at the rate of 22.8 in every 1,000 of the population;
in the City of London it is at the rate of
22.3 for every 1,000 inhabitants! The improvement
has been progressive; it has been slow,
but steady and sure. Gradually the mortality
has decreased, until the yearly death roll of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
3,763 has been reduced to 2,904 within a period
of nine years, during which the city has been
under the rule of the Sanitary Commission.
The deaths this year—22.3 per 1,000, or one in
every forty-five of the inhabitants—are nine
per cent below the general average, and represent
a saving of 286 lives. And secondly, this
gratifying result has been obtained in the face
of obstacles which seemed to be almost insurmountable.”</p>

<p>Liverpool affords a striking example of the
power of sanitary measures, rigidly enforced to
improve the public health. It was formerly the
most unhealthy city of England, being the very
home of typhus, smallpox, and allied preventable
diseases. But it adopted vigorous measures
of reform, improving its poorer districts,
and the death-rate has fallen eight in 1,000.
Macclesfield, Salisbury, and many other English
towns have had their mortality reduced 8,
10, and 15 in 1,000 by the vigorous prosecution
of sanitary improvements. All the populous
towns of that country are moving in this reform,
and, as a result, the general death-rate of towns
is approximating that of the country.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> Health Officer of London announced that
cleanliness would preserve a town from the
visitations of epidemics. But there must be
cleanliness of the streets, cleanliness of the

<span class="sni">Cleanliness Preserves<br>
from Epidemics</span>

courts, cleanliness of the apartments, and cleanliness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
of the person. On the approach of the
cholera in 1849 the
town of Worcester,
England, determined
to test the theory, and
set vigorously to work and cleaned the town
thoroughly, removing everything of an offensive
nature, and adopting the most stringent regulations
against the accumulation of filth about or
within the homes of the people. The result
was that this “destroyer” of unclean cities
made a Passover with the people of Worcester,
for on every lintel and door-post was written—Cleanliness,
Cleanliness. Not a house was
entered, and the town was saved in the midst
of the most frightful desolation.</p>

<p>New Orleans is another striking example of
the value of civic cleanliness. Since, by military
regulations, it is kept constantly in a cleanly
condition, it has had no visitation of its old enemy,
yellow fever.</p>

<p>The degree of public health of a town is
therefore measured by its cleanliness, and its
capacity for health depends upon its capacity
for cleanliness.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">There</span> is scarcely a city which has such absolute
need of an efficient and intelligent
sanitary government as New York. On its
small territory three, four, or five millions of

<span class="sni">Importance of Sanitary<br>
Government</span>

people are yet to be accommodated with houses.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
Already there are crowded upon less than eight
of its thirty-two
square miles all of our
commercial, business,
and manufacturing
interests, and the houses of nearly 1,000,000 of
people. And in the natural relations of the poor
and rich, the former consisting of more than
half of the entire population, are crowded into
less than a fourth of this area. Of what vast
importance is it that a wise and intelligent
authority be vigilantly exercised, so that in its
future growth and expansion every condition
pertaining to health shall be secured to its inhabitants!</p>

<p>It is universally conceded that New York has
in the highest degree all the natural advantages
of salubrity. Its climate is the mean between
the extremes of heat and cold; its topographical
peculiarities are admirably adapted
for drainage and sewerage; its exposure is
southern; its shores are swept by two rivers,
which bear seaward everything that enters them
beyond the power of the flowing tide to return
it; its rural surroundings are of the most healthful.
In every respect it is regarded by competent
observers as most favorably located for
cleanliness, and the highest degree of public
health. And there can be no doubt, that should
New York be placed under a wise sanitary government,
which would improve all its natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
advantages for health, it would become the
cleanest and healthiest city in the world, and
one of the most delightful places of residence.</p>

<p class="section b"><span class="dc">But</span> this is not a matter which concerns the
citizens of New York alone. The people of
the State have a vital interest in the public
health of our city. Connected as it is by means
of rapid inter-communication with all parts of
the country, there is every

<span class="sni">The Entire Country<br>
Concerned</span>

facility offered for the
wide diffusion of the
seeds of contagion. It is
estimated by accurate statisticians that no less
than 250,000 persons pass in and out of New
York daily over the ferries and railroads. It
could not fail to happen that if any contagious
disease prevailed in this city, it would be
carried into the country and widely disseminated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
And such is now a matter of daily occurrence.
There is no doubt that nearly all the
epidemics of smallpox in country towns, and
much of the typhus and similar diseases, have
their origin in New York. I have in my hand
letters from all parts of the State confirming this
statement. They strikingly illustrate the want
of a good sanitary police in New York, and the
power of a great commercial centre to scatter
disease broadcast over the country.</p>

<p>A few of these cases will abundantly illustrate
the point:</p>

<p>Dr. J.&nbsp;S. Sprague, of Cooperstown, Otsego
County, reports the occurrence of twenty-six
cases of smallpox in that town, communicated
by one person in October, 1860, who took the
disease at a hotel in our city, in which a person
with the disease had recently died. He was a
merchant, and came to the city on business.</p>

<p>Dr. C.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;F. Gay, of Buffalo, reports the case
of a female, who arrived from New York in
November, 1860, and was removed from the
cars of the Erie Railroad to the State Line Road,
and proceeded westward. As was afterward
ascertained, she had smallpox, and communicated
the disease at Columbus, Ohio, where
there were three deaths produced by it. Four
deaths were directly traceable to this exposure,
viz.: three milkmen and one baggage man, all of
whom came in contact with the sick woman.</p>

<p>W.&nbsp;T. Babbitt mentions the case of a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
man who took the disease in this city at a hotel
where it was prevailing, at which he stopped
while on a visit here, in whom the disease appeared
after his return to Olean, in Cattaraugus
County.</p>

<p>Dr. M. Jarvis, of Canestota, Madison County,
relates the case of a man who visited this city
with horses for sale, and was attacked with
symptoms of smallpox some ten days after his
return to Smithfield, in that county, who communicated
the disease to his family, from whom
it spread to others in that and, also, in a neighboring
town.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Dr.</span> C.&nbsp;M. Noble, of Waverley, Delaware
County, mentions the case of a merchant
of that place, who came to this city with
his wife, and went to one of our most frequented
hotels. Being very much fatigued, they retired
to the room provided

<span class="sni">Smallpox in a<br>
Hotel Bedroom</span>

for them without any particular
examination of it—but
found in the morning
that they had been put in a room from which
a patient with smallpox had just been removed,
without its having been cleansed. The gentleman
was seized with a malignant form of that
disease after his return home. Two deaths and
six cases of smallpox and varioloid resulted
from this case.</p>

<p>Dr. S.&nbsp;W. Turner, of Chester, Connecticut,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
gives also two cases, one of smallpox and one
of varioloid, in that and a neighboring place,
which could be traced to this city.</p>

<p>Dr. Snow, the vigilant Health Officer of Providence,
R.&nbsp;I., states that smallpox is rarely
known in that city, except when imported from
New York.</p>

<p class="section i"><span class="dc">I</span> could repeat these details until it was
shown that nearly every town in the State,
and nearly every city in the country, has been
inoculated by New York with this most loathsome
disease. The most striking and most
melancholy instances of

<span class="sni">New York Inoculates<br>
the Nation</span>

the free dissemination
of contagion are found
in the army, where
whole regiments have been stricken with smallpox
through infected clothing manufactured at
the homes of the poor, where the disease was
prevailing. But these are facts too well known
to every medical man, and even to the community,
to require further illustration.</p>

<p>What terror smallpox creates in country towns
when it attacks its first victim, you very well
know. The house where it occurs is quarantined,
and not unfrequently the sufferer is deserted
by his friends, and left to recover or die,
as the case may be. Business with the country
is often suspended by the placards posted upon
the highways, with the terrifying word “Smallpox”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
upon them, and a finger pointing ominously
to the town. In nine cases out of ten,
another finger should point toward New York,
as the source of the pestilence.</p>

<p>It has been estimated by a competent observer,
that every case of smallpox in a country
town costs, by derangement of business alone,
more money than is annually expended upon
its public schools. If we add to this pecuniary
loss the feverish excitement and popular apprehension,
and the sufferings and probable death
of the victim from want of proper care, we may
but indifferently estimate the cost to the country
of the prevalence of this disease.</p>

<p>Now, this diffusion of contagion from New
York, we contend, is unnecessary. Every well-informed
medical man knows that we may have
a sanitary police so vigilant, so efficient and so
powerful, that it will not only preserve the public
health, but prevent the spread of disease
therefrom. We hold, therefore, that you are not
only called upon to protect the people of the
City of New York from contagious disease, but
equally that you are bound to protect the people
of the State from dissemination of pestilence
by every legislative safeguard which sanitary
science can suggest.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> Sanitary Committee of the Board of
Health, during the prevalence of cholera in
1849, remark in their report:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
“The labors of your committee, during the

<span class="sni">Inefficiency of<br>
Health Organizations</span>

past appalling season of sickness and death,
and the awful scenes of
degradation, misery, and
filth developed to them
by their researches,
have brought into full view the fact that we
have no sanitary police worthy of the name;
that we are unprotected by that watchful regard
over the public health which common sense dictates
to be necessary for the security of our
lives, the maintenance of the city’s reputation,
and the preservation of the interests of the inhabitants.”</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">This</span> is a perfectly truthful statement of the
present condition of New York. Practically,
it is a city without any sanitary government.
In its growth it is developing the natural history
of a city that utterly ignores all rules and
regulations which tend to

<span class="sni">Without Sanitary<br>
Government</span>

make the homes of its people
pleasant and healthy.
It is the only city in
the civilized world which disregards the Platonic
idea that in a model republic medical men
should be selected to preserve and promote the
public health. Its board of health, the mayor
and common council, is an unwieldly body.
Its commissioners of health have limited powers,
and are equally incompetent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> City Inspector’s department, which alone
has the machinery for sanitary inspection
and surveillance, is a gigantic imposture. Of
its forty-four health wardens, whose duty it
should be to make house-to-house inspections,
searching out the cause

<span class="sni">The City Inspector’s<br>
Department</span>

of disease, and using
every known agency for
the control and suppression
of epidemics, many are liquor dealers, and
all are grossly ignorant. Not one has any
knowledge of medical subjects, nor dare they
freely visit such diseases as smallpox, typhus,
or cholera.</p>

<p>During this entire voluntary inspection, extending
over six months, health wardens have
rarely been known to visit infected quarters, although
smallpox, fever, etc., etc., have been prevalent,
and the city has been in a most disgracefully
filthy condition. A single health warden
recently ventured to visit a house where smallpox
existed in an upper room; he sent for the
attendant, and when she appeared, ordering
her not to approach him, he gave the following
as the best means of prevention: “Burn camphor
on the stove, and hang bags of camphor
about the necks of the children.”</p>

<p>To what depth of humiliation must that community
have descended, which tolerates as its
sanitary officers men who are not only utterly
disqualified by education, business, and moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
character, but who have not even the poor
qualification of courage to perform their duties.
But perhaps the most decisive proof of the utter
and hopeless inefficiency of our multiform
health arrangements is found in the fact that all
the evils from which we now suffer have grown
up under their care. A late City Inspector thus
emphatically gave expression to the popular
feeling in regard to existing organizations:</p>

<p>“With such a system, can there be a wonder
that the sanitary condition of the city is not improved?
* * * Nor must the consideration be
kept from view, that the members of the common
council, the board of health, and commissioners
of health are all, from the manner of
their appointment, subject to partisan influence.
To expect a perfect sanitary system,
under such a condition of things, is to expect
an impossibility.”</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> medical officer of health for the City of
London, a gentleman of large experience,
thus defines a health organization capable of
answering the demands of a large and growing
town: “The object of this organization lies in
a word: inspection, inspection of

<span class="sni">Sanitary<br>
Inspection</span>

the most constant, most searching,
most intelligent, and most trustworthy
kind, is that in which the
provisional management of our sanitary affairs
must essentially consist.” The results of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
work of voluntary sanitary inspection which I
have before me prove on every page the truth of
the above statement. No health organization without
daily inspection would have any efficiency.</p>

<p>Of the value of such thorough inspection in
the suppression of epidemics, and in the prevention
of disease, there are abundant examples.
The people of a populous town of England,
becoming alarmed at the approach of cholera
in 1849, organized a corps of inspectors,
whose duty it was to visit from house to house,
and inquire for cases of premonitory diarrhoea,
and when found to apply the remedy at once.
The result was that cholera did not visit that
town. The same systematic house-to-house
visitation was adopted in some poor districts of
London in 1854, and there was an almost complete
exemption of those parts of the city, while
some quarters of the wealthy, which were not
under such surveillance, suffered severely.</p>

<p class="section b"><span class="dc">But</span> it is essential that this inspection should
be by thoroughly qualified medical men,
and it must consist in a house-to-house visitation.
Disease must be sought for, found, its
incipient history completely made out, the
causes upon which it depends

<span class="sni">Inspection Must<br>

reported, and its remedy
suggested. Every case of
death should be visited, and
all the circumstances attending the development<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
of the disease, if it belong to the preventable
class, should be rigidly investigated and reported,
in order that the central bureau may
apply the proper remedy.</p>

STREETS, 1865</div></div>

<p>Striking examples
of the value of
medical sanitary
inspection are furnished
by this voluntary
organization.
One inspector
found diarrhoeal
affections very
prevalent in a settlement
in an up-town
ward, and for
a long time was
baffled in his efforts
to discover
the cause. He was
finally led to examine
the water of
a neighboring well,
which the people
used. This water
appeared to be of
an excellent quality,
but on examination
by Prof.
Draper, it was found to contain a large amount
of organic matter, derived either from a sewer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
or privy. Prof. Draper pronounced it liquid
poison. The mystery was at once solved, and
the proper remedy suggested.</p>

<p>In another instance a very contagious disease
was found in a tenant-house, and after a long
course of inquiry it was at length discovered
that a washer-woman, living in the basement,
had taken in sailors’ clothing. The sailors
were found, the ship visited from which they
came, and there the disease was found. None
but medical men can prosecute such investigations
with success, or suggest the proper remedy.
If such a corps of sanitary inspectors were
daily patrolling their districts, visiting from
house to house, searching out sanitary evils, advising
and aiding the people in the adoption of
preventive measures, no epidemics of smallpox,
typhus, scarlet fever, or cholera would ever gain
more than a transient foothold. The sanitary
inspector would truly become an officer of
health and would be everywhere welcome.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> remedy for our evils must be apparent;
and this remedy is suggested in such terse
unqualified language by the City Inspector
above quoted, that I call the attention of the
committee especially to this remark,
as a proper guide in your deliberations.

<span class="sni">The<br>
Remedy</span>

In the City Inspector’s report
for 1861 we find the following:</p>

<p>“The stay of pestilence, to be effectual,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
must be prompt, and equally prompt must
be the interposition of barriers against the
introduction of disease, which may be kept
back, but, once introduced, can with difficulty
be checked or extirpated. For these reasons,
there should be a power existing in other hands
that may be ready to be used at the moment the
exigency may arise.” * * * “The remedy, apparent
to every one, must consist in the adoption
of laws transferring the power of sanitary
regulations to some other authority of a different
order of instruction in sanitary science.”
* * * “The first groundwork of reform, in the
opinion of the undersigned, is to bestow upon
some other body, differently constituted, all
power over the sanitary affairs of the city; and,
until this is done, all other proposals of reform
will be deprived of their essentially beneficial
features. To escape present complications is
the first great point to be gained; and this point
secured, simplicity, promptness, and efficiency
may be substituted for inefficiency, complication,
and delay.”</p>

<p>Accepting this as the first step in reform, the
practical question arises: How shall that body
be constituted to which is to be confided the
sanitary interests of New York?</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">If</span> the experience of other large cities is of any
value, or, indeed, if we rely simply on common
sense, the following are indispensable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
prerogatives in any well-organized health
board:</p>

<p>1. It should be independent
of all political influence and
above all partisan control.</p>

<p>2. It should combine executive
ability with a profound knowledge of disease
and the proper measures of prevention. To
this end the board should be composed in part

<span class="sni">An Efficient<br>
Health Board</span>

of men especially accustomed to the dispatch
of business, and in part of medical men of great
skill and experience.</p>

<p>3. It should have a corps of skilled medical
officers as inspectors, which should be the eyes,
the ears, in a word, the senses of the board, in
every part of the city, searching out disease, investigating
the causes which give rise to it, the
conditions under which it exists, the means of
its propogation, and the most effectual mode of
its suppression.</p>

<p>4. It should have a close alliance with the
police, which must be its arm of power in the
prompt and efficient execution of its orders.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case left2">The</span> effect of this startling exhibition
of the horrible sanitary
condition of New York, both
upon the joint committees and
the large audience, was evidently
very profound. And
this effect was heightened by
the early denials by the then City Inspector and

<span class="sni">Effect of the<br>
Hearing</span>

his followers of the truth of the description of
the condition of special localities,
and the immediate exhibitions
by the speaker of the sworn
statements of the Physician-Inspectors
of the Citizens’ Association, with photographic
illustrations. Pressed by members
of the committee to state when he last had these
places inspected, he admitted that they had
never been inspected by his Department.</p>

<p>Intense interest was manifested in the custom
of wholesale dealers in clothing of having their
goods manufactured in tenement houses; in the
fact that Inspectors had often found such clothing
thrown over the beds or cradles of children
suffering from contagious diseases, as scarlet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
fever, measles, smallpox; and in the evidence
that these diseases were distributed widely over
the country by this infected clothing. Several
of the committee seemed much disturbed, as did
the audience, during a recital of cases, and when
the hearing closed, one of the committee said
to me, in an excited manner, “Why, I bought
underwear at one of those stores a few days
ago, and I believe I have got smallpox, for I
begin to itch all over!”</p>

<p>Indeed, the effect of the discussion before the
joint committees was so favorable, that several
members declared that the bill would immediately
pass both Houses without opposition.
But the City Inspector secured delay by requesting
another hearing, in order to investigate the
facts presented in my quotations from the report
of our inspection. This delay gave him
the desired opportunity to defeat the bill, by
means at his command and by methods familiar
to that class of politicians.</p>

<p>But the public, and especially the medical profession,
both of the city and the State, had become
so interested in the measure that at the
next election it became a prominent issue and
led to the defeat of seventeen candidates for the
Legislature of 1866 who had voted in opposition.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">It</span> is said that epidemics are the best promoters
of sanitary reform, and very opportunely
cholera made its dread appearance in Europe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
late in 1865, and from its rate of progress it

<span class="sni">Triumph<br>
at Last</span>

seemed likely to visit our shores early next
year. These favoring conditions led
to the passage of the “Metropolitan
Health Law” among the first measures
of the Legislature in 1866.</p>

<p>The struggle and final triumph of the people
of New York, in their efforts to secure adequate
health protection, were national in their influence.
And this influence was emphasized
by the first acts of the Metropolitan Board.
Scarcely had it organized when cholera made
its appearance in New York. There was the
usual alarm among the people, and large numbers
left the city. But the new health laws and
ordinances, administered by an intelligent,
scientific authority, demonstrated the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">raison
d’être</i> of their existence.</p>

<p>The first case of cholera was promptly
isolated, the house and its surroundings
cleansed and disinfected, and rigid supervision
established. The second case, which appeared
in another part of the city, was treated in a
similar manner and with the same results. A
third, fourth, fifth, and finally many cases appeared
in different parts of the city during the
season, apparently brought from localities in
the vicinity where the epidemic prevailed with
its usual severity; but in New York no two cases
occurred in the same place, so effectually was
each case treated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
Within one month public confidence in the
power of the board to control the spread of the
disease was firmly established; people who had
fled returned to their homes; business in commercial
districts, which was at first suspended,
was resumed; and the health department became
the most popular branch of the city government,
a position which it has maintained uninterruptedly
for nearly half a century.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">This</span> popular triumph of sanitation is largely
due to the perfection of the original Metropolitan
Law, which has been declared, officially
and judicially, to be the most complete
piece of health legislation ever placed on the
statute books. From that

<span class="sni">The Reform National<br>
in Its Results</span>

fountain of legal lore
the whole country has
been supplied with both
the principles and the details of sanitary legislation.</p>

<p>The agitation in New York rapidly extended
over the entire country, and other cities secured
the necessary authority, the Metropolitan Law
being the basis of such health legislation.
Within a decade nearly every municipality in
the land had its health laws and sanitary ordinances
and a competent authority to enforce
them.</p>

<p>The enormous influence which this reform
has had upon the health and domestic life of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
the people can never be estimated. A reference
to the former and present sickness and death-rates
of New York enables us to approximate
the vast saving of life and consequent prevention
of sickness and human misery that has resulted
from health laws founded on the Metropolitan
Law and intelligently but rightly enforced.
Before the passage of that law the annual
death-rate of the city fluctuated between
28 and 40 per 1,000 population; since that law
went into effect it has steadily fallen until it has
reached the low figure of fifteen to the thousand,
or a saving of more than twenty thousand
lives annually when the population of New York
was only about one million, and of nearly
10,000 lives of the present population. If we extend
this estimate to the whole country, of
ninety-five million people, we may gain a faint
conception of the inestimable benefits which the
application of sanitary knowledge to the daily
life of a people can accomplish.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0">The following chapter consists of the address delivered
by Dr. Stephen Smith on the occasion of the memorial
service of Hon. Dorman B. Eaton, January 21, 1899.
We have inserted it immediately following his historic
review of the events which led up to the great public
health reform of 1865–1866, not only because it is a
fitting tribute to the memory of one to whom the citizens
of New York are indebted for many improvements
in the administration of the municipal government,
but because it brings together in one compact
perspective the legal and sanitary requirements of
modern preventive medicine.—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>F.&nbsp;A.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case left2">The</span> progress of the race is largely
affected in each generation by
a few pioneers who, with toil
and sacrifice, prepare the way
for the advance. Of these pioneers
some blaze the future
course in the unexplored and

<span class="sni">Unrecognized<br>
Pioneers</span>

trackless forest; others remove the obstructions
which impede the builders; while a few expert
engineers bridge the rivers,
tunnel the mountains and lay
broad and deep the foundations
of the great highway along
which humanity passes to a higher civilization.
Unfortunately these pioneers are not always
known to public fame, and far too often, though
benefactors of their race, pass away without a
proper recognition of their services.</p>

<p>This apparent neglect is not due to a lack of
appreciation of their work by the people, but
rather to the fact that their labors are performed
in obscurity, and hence are unknown.
Far in the wilderness, or deep in the tunnel, or
in the mire of the caisson, they toil all unseen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
by their generation, sacrificing health and often
life while searching for the true pathway or laying
its foundations. When the bridges are
builded, the tunnels completed, and the broad
highway is thrown open for travel and traffic,
few or none of the passing throng give a moment’s
thought to the labors and sacrifices of
the builders, or the tribute of a sigh to the memory
of those who perished at their work.</p>

<p>Impressed with a sense of public obligation
and of a duty to the memory of a citizen with
whose labors and sacrifices in the interests of
this city I had great opportunities to become familiar,
it has been a grateful task to place on
record some of the incidents in the life of Hon.
Dorman B. Eaton as they came under my personal
observation. He was by nature, education,
and association a reformer of the civil administration.
Born and bred in the rural communities
of Vermont, educated at Harvard, a
partner of the famous Judge Kent, of this city,
and an associate of men of the type of William
Curtis Noyes, Charles O’Conor, and others of
equal reputation, Mr. Eaton was admirably
equipped for the great work to which he devoted
so much of his life and energies.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Nor</span> was he a reformer whose methods were
simply destructive of what he regarded as
wrong or evil in the municipal government;
on the contrary, his mind was eminently constructive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>

<span class="sni">A Constructive<br>
Reformer</span>

and consequently he sought to remedy
defects by substituting the new
and best for the old and worst
with as little friction and disturbance
as possible. Thus he
quietly and without observation, as a master
builder, laid foundations and reared the massive
superstructures of four of the best-organized
and most efficient departments of our city government—viz.,
the Department of Health, the
Fire Department, the Department of Docks, the
Police Judiciary.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">My</span> personal acquaintance with Mr. Eaton began
in the year 1864, when we became associated
in an effort to secure reforms in
the sanitary government of the City of New
York. Although prior to this date there had
been periods of agitation
in favor of a more

<span class="sni">Character of Previous<br>
Agitation</span>

efficient health organization,
especially
when epidemics, like cholera, visited the
city and the utter worthlessness of our
health officials became apparent, yet there
had been no such organized effort as that of
1864. Previous agitation had, however, been
very useful in preparing the way for the final
struggle, by creating a popular interest in these
reforms and in rendering the public mind both
sympathetic and receptive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">In</span> 1855 the Academy of Medicine applied to
the Legislature for relief from the evils of an
insufficient health organization, and as a result
a committee of that body investigated the
sanitary condition of the city. It appeared that

<span class="sni">Incompetent<br>
Health Officers</span>

there were four separate departments
devoted to the conservation
of the public health.
First, was the Board of
Health, composed of the Aldermen and Mayor.
When this body was organized as a Board of
Health it had supreme power, both in the abatement
of nuisances and the expenditure of
money. So much and so justly was this board
feared, that Fernando Wood, while Mayor, refused
to call it into existence during an epidemic
of cholera, declaring that the Board of
Health was more to be feared than the pestilence.</p>

<p>Second, was the Commissioners of Health,
composed of the Mayor and the Recorder, the
City Inspector, the Health Commissioner, the
Resident Physician, and the Port Health Officer.
This body had no adequate power and was perfectly
useless both for good and evil.</p>

<p>Third, was the Resident Physician, whose duties
were limited to visiting the sick poor.</p>

<p>Fourth, was the City Inspector, a most formidable
official politically, for he had the right to
expend annually $1,000,000 without “let or hindrance.”
His jurisdiction extended to the cleaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
of the street, gathering vital statistics, and
preserving the public health by the appointment
of health wardens for each ward.</p>

<p>The investigation showed that this department,
the only one which actually exercised
public health functions, was permeated with
corruption, ignorance, and venality. The City
Inspector was the lowest type of ward politician,
the vital statistics were crude and unreliable,
there was no pretense of cleaning the streets,
and the health wardens were for the most part
keepers of saloons. It was shown in the evidence
that no health warden ever dared to visit
a house where there was a case of contagious
disease. One, who was asked the best method of
preventing smallpox, replied: “Burn sulphur in
the room.” Another, asked to define the term
“hygiene,” said: “It is a mist rising from wet
grounds.”</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> report of this committee created a profound
sensation and gave the first impetus
to a reform movement. A number of prominent
physicians and influential citizens became
deeply interested in the subject and determined
to secure proper

<span class="sni">Reform Movement<br>
Born</span>

legislation. Health bills
were annually prepared
and sent to the Legislature
only to be rejected under the direction of the
City Inspector, whose $1,000,000 was expended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
freely in the lobby at Albany. But the agitation
increased in force with successive defeats, a
large and still larger number of people were
added to the ranks of the reformers of the Citizens’
Association in 1864, with Peter Cooper as
President and upwards of a hundred of the
leading citizens as members.</p>

<p>The moving spirit in organizing and managing
this powerful body was Mr. Nathaniel Sands,
an ardent and enthusiastic sanitarian. Two departments
were created in the Association,
through which the principal work was to be
done; viz., a Council of Law and a Council of
Hygiene. Mr. Eaton was an active member of
the former, and I was for a considerable time
Secretary of the latter. Thus we were brought
into frequent consultation over a public health
law, which the Association had determined to
have prepared for the next Legislature.</p>

<p>It was decided that the Council of Hygiene
should make a first draft of the bill in which
should be incorporated the necessary sanitary
provisions. This draft was then to be submitted
to the Legal Council for completion in legislative
form. As secretary of the Council of Hygiene
I had to prepare the first draft of the bill,
which was done along the lines of former bills
and seemed to the members to be a very perfect
piece of work. When, however, the bill came
from the Legal Council, scarcely a shred of the
original draft was recognizable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Though</span> the Legal Council was composed of
the leading lawyers of the city at that time,
the revision and completion of the health
law was committed to Mr. Eaton, a junior member.
This selection proved to be of immense
importance to the immediate sanitary

<span class="sni">The Right<br>
Man</span>

interests of this city, and
secondarily to the creation and administration
of the health laws of
the United States. The field of sanitary legislation
was entirely uncultivated in this country
at that time, and the principles on which health
laws should be based were unrecognized, except
by the more advanced students.</p>

<p>Mr. Eaton fortunately proved to be one of the
few citizens who had kept pace with the progress
of sanitary reforms in England, and entered
fully into the spirit of the great movement
that for a quarter of a century had agitated
the people of that country. Alarmed by
the high death-rate annually reported by the
Registrar-General, and informed that the larger
part was due to preventable diseases, the public
demanded adequate remedial measures of the
government. The contest was long and most
exciting, the issues often being carried into the
arena of politics. The Prime Minister once declared
that there was such a craze about sanitation
that the rallying cry of an election campaign
might well be “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sanitas sanitatum, et omnia
sanitas</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
The triumph of the reformers was finally complete,
and England adopted a code of health
laws that are models of excellence, and which,
in their enforcement, have made its cities and
towns the healthiest in the world.</p>

<p>When our health bill came from the hands
of Mr. Eaton it was evident in every line that he
had made an exhaustive study of the English
health code and had become thoroughly imbued
with its spirit. The language was not altogether
familiar, and in the involved sentences there
were intimations of extraordinary powers quite
unknown to our jurisprudence. When he
brought the completed bill before the Legal and
Medical councils for adoption it was subjected
to a most searching criticism. While most of its
sections were clear and readily understood,
there were portions which were so obscure, owing
to the methods of expression employed, that
the legal members were in doubt as to the
proper construction to be put upon them, while
the medical members were altogether at a loss
as to their meaning.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Mr.</span> Eaton explained the theory of modern
health legislation as illustrated by the English
laws, and contended that a thoroughly
organized and efficient board of health must
have extraordinary powers, and must not be

<span class="sni">A Board With<br>
Extraordinary Powers</span>

subordinated to any other branch of the civil
service, not even to the courts. What it declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
to be a nuisance—dangerous to life and detrimental
to health—no
one should call in question.
When it ordered
a nuisance to be
abated within a given fixed time no mandate
should avail to stay its action or the enforcement
of its decree.</p>

<p>A board of health, in his opinion, should
make its own laws, execute its own laws, and
sit in judgment on its own acts. It must be an
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">imperium in imperio</i>. England, the foremost
country in the world in the cultivation of sanitary
science and in the application of its principles
to practice, had by its legislation for a
quarter of a century established a precedent
which it was right and safe for us to follow.</p>

<p>He predicted that if this bill became a law its
operations would be so beneficial that it would
not only become very popular in this city, but
that it would be the basis of future health legislation
in this country. He believed, however,
that no legislature would pass a bill containing
such powers if these powers were made a
prominent feature of the bill. For that reason
he had adopted that involved expression peculiar
to English law which required a judicial
interpretation to determine the precise meaning.
The bill was approved in the form presented
by Mr. Eaton, and preparation was made
to secure its passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p class="section al"><span class="dc">As</span> the City Inspector with his health wardens
always appeared at Albany when a health
bill was before the Legislature, denying
vociferously the alleged unsanitary condition of
the city, Mr. Eaton advised that the Association
make a careful inspection of the

<span class="sni">The Fight for<br>
the Bill</span>

city with its own inspectors.
This inspection was organized
by the Council of Hygiene and
prosecuted during the summer of 1864 by young
physicians, and was the most exhaustive study
of the sanitary condition ever made of a city,
even by officials. The results were published in
a large volume which has been pronounced by
authorities at home and abroad as equal to the
best official reports of European cities.</p>

<p>The bill was early introduced into the Legislature
of 1865. In due time it came before a joint
committee of both houses, with Senator Andrew
D. White in the chair. The City Inspector, with
his health wardens, was present, and a large attendance
of members with several prominent
citizens of New York. At Mr. Eaton’s request
I described the deplorable sanitary condition of
the city as revealed by our inspections and explained
the medical features of the bill. He
followed with a brilliant and exhaustive speech
on the nature of sanitary legislation and the
value to cities of adequate health laws administered
by well-organized boards of health.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the hearing the members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
of the committee assured us that if the two
houses were in session they would pass the bill
at once. But we were doomed to disappointment.
The City Inspector secured delays, and
meantime employed through his agents the
means at his command to defeat the bill. The
agitation, however, was continued during the
year, chiefly through the <i>New York Times</i>, then
under the management of Mr. Raymond, an
ardent reformer.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Mr.</span> Eaton advised the Medical Council to
interest the physicians of the country, and
especially urge them not to nominate men
who had voted against the bill in the last Legislature.
This plan was carried out, and seventeen
former members failed

<span class="sni">A Law Enacted<br>
and Sustained</span>

of renomination to the Assembly.
The result of this
scheme succeeded admirably,
for the new Legislature was to some extent
pledged to support the bill when they came to
the capitol. The bill promptly passed both
houses early in the session of 1866, and in
March the Metropolitan Board of Health was
organized. Mr. Eaton accepted the position of
counsellor to the board, which position he retained
several years.</p>

<p>As he had anticipated, a suit against the Board
was early commenced to test the constitutionality
of the law. He was very apprehensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
of the results, and made the most thorough preparation
to argue the case. He was successful
in the lower courts, and finally won in the Court
of Appeals by a majority of one. He always regarded
his success in the management of this
case as one of the most important events of his
life, for on the decision of the highest court depended
the fate of health legislation in this country.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">No</span> one unfamiliar with the sanitary condition
of this city prior to 1864 can form any adequate
conception of the enormous benefits
conferred, not only upon this metropolis, but
upon the entire country, by the labors of Mr.
Eaton and his associates in

<span class="sni">The Regeneration<br>
of New York</span>

securing to it the Metropolitan
Health Law. During
the former period New
York was a prey to every form of pestilence
known to man. Smallpox, the most preventable
of contagious diseases, was epidemic in this city
every five years, and created a large death-rate
among the children. Scarlet fever and diphtheria
spread through the city without the
slightest effort on the part of the officials to control
them. Cholera visited us once in ten years
without any adequate measures of prevention.
The mortality was greater than of any other city
of a civilized country, it being estimated that
7,000 died yearly from preventable diseases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
The tenement-house population lived under
the most unhealthy and degrading conditions,
a prey to greedy landlords, and without any possible
relief or redress. In one notorious building,
which covered an ordinary city lot, were
fifty families, with a total population of five
hundred persons.</p>

<p>Here every form of domestic pestilence
could be found at all seasons of the year.
Still more deplorable was the condition
of the tenants of cellars. Of these so-called
“Troglodytes” there were 5,000 living in rooms
the ceilings of which were below the level of the
surface of the street.</p>

<p>To the present generation it may appear incredible
that there was neither law, ordinance,
nor department of the city government capable
of giving the slightest relief. This was illustrated
in an attempt to break up a fever nest in 1860.
The landlord refused to make the slightest repairs,
or cleansing, in a tenement house from
which upwards of one hundred cases of fever
have been removed to the hospital.</p>

<p>The attorney to the Police Department
was unable to find any law or ordinance
by which he could be compelled to cleanse,
repair, or vacate the house. It was only
by confronting him in court, to which
he had been brought on a fictitious charge, with
a reporter, that he was induced to take any
steps to improve the tenement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Now</span> everything relating to the public health
is so changed that it is almost impossible to
realize the condition of the city in 1866. The
change began with the very organization of the
Metropolitan Board. Within a few days of that

<span class="sni">Epidemics<br>
Checked</span>

event, cholera, which had devastated
portions of Europe, made
its appearance in this city; but it
met with a far different reception
than that of former visitations. The first case
was quarantined within an hour of its occurrence;
the clothing of the patient was destroyed,
the room disinfected, and a sanitary guard
placed over the house. No other case appeared
in that quarter of the city. There were several
similar outbreaks in different parts of the town,
but each was treated with the same vigilance
and energy, and the contagion never secured a
foothold in the city or the metropolitan district.</p>

<p>Though cholera has since appeared in Europe
at its usual intervals, and has several times
been at our doors, it has not been able to invade
the city for a period of thirty-four years.
Smallpox, which once decimated the child population
every five years, has not been epidemic
in a whole generation. Diphtheria and the
whole brood of domestic pestilences are diminishing
in frequency and fatality. Even consumption,
so common and fatal among the
poor, is rapidly disappearing in consequence of
the improved condition of the tenement houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
And what a vast change has been made in the
homes of the poor! No human habitation is
underground; the ancient rookery, with its five
hundred inhabitants, is a past number; the
dark, foul courts are disappearing, and in their
places have arisen the modern tenements, with
their light, airy, and cheerful apartments, and
all the conditions necessary to family health
and domestic happiness. The laws and ordinances
all conspire to compel the landlords to
remedy every defect on complaint of the tenant;
the penalty being that the latter need not pay
rent until the home is made habitable in a sanitary
sense. The vital statistics show that human
life is lengthening in this city, and that the
entire metropolis is more healthy as a place of
residence than the surrounding country towns.</p>

<p class="section b"><span class="dc">But</span> the beneficent results of the labors of Mr.
Eaton and his associates in the field of sanitary
legislation are not confined to New
York. As he predicted, the Metropolitan Health
Law became the basis of sanitary legislation
throughout the country. At the

<span class="sni">Sanitation in<br>
Other Cities</span>

time of its enactment the municipalities
of the United States
were as destitute of health laws
and regulations as the City of New York. To-day
there is not a city, or even village, that has
not its laws and ordinances relating to the preservation
and promotion of the public health<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
based on the original law drawn by Mr. Eaton.
And the same remark is true of the organized
health administration of the States of the Union,
for on analysis it will be found that their sanitary
legislation is in harmony with the provisions
of that law. Mr. Eaton’s work was broad
and fundamental.</p>

<p class="section al"><span class="dc">At</span> that period the old Volunteer Fire Department
was quite as discreditable to the city as was
its health organization. Intrenched in the
political organizations of the city, it wielded a
power second only to that of the great political

<span class="sni">Reorganization of the<br>
Fire Department</span>

parties themselves. It
required the strength
and courage of a Hercules
to purify this department
by removing the existing elements, reconstructing
the entire organization, substituting
a paid for a volunteer membership, and requiring
a high grade of qualification of its
officers.</p>

<p>But, aided by the Citizens’ Association, Mr.
Eaton undertook this reform, and after a
fierce and prolonged struggle carried it to a
successful conclusion. The law creating the
fire department, like that creating the health department,
is a model of intelligent discrimination
of all the conditions essential to the efficiency
of the service and its permanent freedom
from the vices inherent in the old system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p class="section s"><span class="dc">Scarcely</span> had these reforms been perfected
when Mr. Eaton’s attention was turned by
the Citizens’ Association to the necessity of
having a department in the city government devoted
exclusively to the care and management
of the public docks,

<span class="sni">Creation of a Dock<br>
Department</span>

wharves, and other water-front
interests of the city.
This movement resulted in
the passage of the law drawn by Mr. Eaton
creating the Department of Docks. Though
this Department was to occupy an entirely new
field in the Municipal Administration, the law
shows in every section the same mastery of all
the details peculiar to Mr. Eaton’s legislative
work.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Finally,</span> Mr. Eaton undertook, single-handed,
to reform the police judiciary. He prepared
a bill creating the civil magistrates
to take the place of the police justices and reforming
in many particulars the methods of procedure.
This law is regarded

<span class="sni">Reform of the<br>
Police Judiciary</span>

as a great improvement upon
the previous police judiciary,
but the bill became a law only
after a protracted struggle with the old police
justices, a struggle which Mr. Eaton maintained
alone, relying upon the merits of the measure
which he advocated. The consensus of opinion
of legal authorities is that the new law effected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
radical reforms of great importance in these inferior
courts of criminal jurisprudence in New
York City.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">If</span> we may estimate Mr. Eaton’s mental traits
by the laws which he drafted in the interests
of municipal reform, we can readily conclude
that he had a remarkable genius for constructive
legislation. Though he was compelled to weave
into the very woof of those

<span class="sni">Mental Traits of<br>
Dorman B. Eaton</span>

laws, extraordinary powers,
which he acknowledged
were of vital importance to
their efficiency, and yet would be a menace to
the public, if the laws were administered by
unscrupulous persons, he succeeded in so
guarding those powers that these laws have
been in operation upwards of a quarter of a century;
and, while those who have from time to
time been called to administer them have not
always had the best reputation for intelligence
and civic virtue, yet there has at no time been
any complaint of injustice in their execution,
nor has there been any serious lapse in their
vigorous enforcement. To-day, as a generation
ago, they are accomplishing the full measure of
usefulness for which they were designed by
their author.</p>

<p>Standing now at the close of a life so largely
devoted to the service of his fellow-men and
consecrated to the amelioration of human suffering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
and where we may, in some slight degree,
estimate the vast and ever-increasing
fruition of its labors, how sublime it appears!
Monuments and memorials can but faintly symbolize
its greatness and perpetuate its enduring
force. Mr. Eaton’s own thought of true fame
once was expressed to me thus: “I ask only to
be remembered as one who in his sphere of life’s
duties endeavored to improve the conditions of
human life around him.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case left1">In</span> the retrospect from the vantage
ground of half a century of sanitary
progress we recognize that
during the third quarter of the
last century the people of England
were waging a successful
war on domestic uncleanliness
as a contributory, if not the sole cause of epidemic
diseases. The health officer of England
insisted that domestic filth was the
actual cause of many of the low
forms of disease, and named them
accordingly, “filth diseases.” This
official act of the highest health authority of
that country led to the practice of cleanliness
in the home and its surroundings. Filth in
every form was removed as the necessary remedial

<span class="sni">Filth<br>
Diseases</span>

measure against these diseases, with the
result that not only were foreign pestilences prevented,
but the whole brood of domestic diseases
was greatly reduced in number, and the
severity of cases that did occur was greatly diminished
in virulence.</p>

<p>But during the fourth quarter of the last century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
the question arose among scientists, “Why
is filth—that is, decomposing matter—the
prolific cause of disease?” The answer came
from the famous Pasteur of Paris, and Lister
of Edinburgh. “Filth is dangerous, because it
is filled with germ life. The mere removal of
filth from one locality to another does not
render it harmless, except to those who are no
longer in personal contact with it.” So-called
filth was indeed harmless if the germs it contained
were killed.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> whole scheme of sanitation was at once
changed: agents that would kill germs were
eagerly sought by many scientists, and
germicides were found in abundance. Cremation
was most effectful,
and was available in the
destruction of masses of

<span class="sni">The Scheme of<br>
Sanitation Changed</span>

filth; but there was a
phase of the question that required other methods.</p>

<p>Lister announced that these disease-producing
germs entered wounds and prevented healing,
and that a germicide was required which
would kill the germ in the wound and would
not injure the living, healthy tissue. Further
investigations showed that these dangerous
germs were not confined to dust heaps, but
existed in the unclean recesses of the human
body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
Sternberg startled the world with the announcement
that an unclean human mouth
contained germs of the most poisonous character.</p>

<p>An eminent German surgeon declared that
germs of a dangerous character existed in the
folds of the skin of the palms of the hand which
no amount of washing with soap and water
could remove, and could be destroyed only by
some agent directly applied.</p>

<p>Sanitation of the body as well as of the dust
heap now became the paramount question and
especially did this apply to the practice of surgery.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">How</span> infection affects the body was the
supreme mystery that the scientists of the
past strove in vain to penetrate. By no devices
of their laboratories could they detect the
agents that caused the epidemic. There was
only one satisfactory explanation

<span class="sni">The Mystery<br>
of Infection</span>

of the origin and spread of
the devastating plagues, which
seemed to fall from the heavens
on the people, and that was that epidemics were
“a visitation of God” on account of the sins of
the people. Of course, the only preventive and
curative measure available and effectual was
“repentance, prayer, and humiliation.”</p>

<p>It is a cause of devout thankfulness that while
these things were hidden from the “wise and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
prudent” of former times, they have in these
latter days been revealed unto “babes.” No
event in human history would have more greatly
taxed the credulity of the most learned and experienced
physician of half a century ago than
the prophecy that in the early years of the twentieth
century school children would be taught
by simple and easily understood object lessons
how to prevent and how to cure consumption,
the Asiatic cholera, yellow fever, and other epidemics
that have devastated cities, destroyed
armies, and swept from the earth whole tribes
of primitive people.</p>

<p>But that prophecy has been literally fulfilled.
During the last summer there has been a traveling
object lesson that visited the different sections
of the State of New York and taught the
people, especially the children, all the essential
facts as to the nature of the infection of tuberculosis,
its effects on the body, and the methods
of prevention and cure.</p>

<p class="section al"><span class="dc">As</span> infective diseases cause the vast majority
of cases of severe and crippling affections
and of deaths in every community, the
value of a knowledge of the nature of infection
and how it affects the body, by the people of all

<span class="sni">How Infection<br>
Works</span>

ranks, ages, and conditions, cannot be estimated
in its influence on the future of the human race.
Already we learn that within the period referred
to the sickness and death-rates of communities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
where the people have been most thoroughly instructed
as to the nature of infective
diseases, and how they
affect the body, have greatly
diminished, and the average
human life has been markedly lengthened.
Indeed, it now seems possible to restore
the patriarchal age when a man
may live to be “an hundred and twenty
years old ... his eye ... not dim, nor his
natural force abated.”</p>

<p>To understand how infection affects the body
involves an inquiry as to the nature of infection,
its mode of entrance into the body, and its
operation on its organs and tissues. The terms
“infection” and “contagion” are often used as
synonymous; but a strict definition according
to the medical significance of each limits the
former to “the transmission of disease by actual
contact of the diseased part with a healthy absorbent
or abraded surface,” and the latter to
“transmission through the atmosphere by floating
germs.” But in the final analysis the cause
of disease in both infection and contagion is so
similar in its action that the medical profession
has adopted the term “communicable disease”
in all cases where the disease is communicated
from one person to another by means of a
germ, whatever may be its method of attack on
the body. The common characteristic of “communicable
diseases” is their germ origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">What</span> is this communicable germ or agent?
A bacterium—a little stick, staff—so
called from the rodlike shape it assumes
in the process of growth. The individual bacterium
(plural, bacteria) is an organism representing
a low form of vegetable

<span class="sni">What the<br>
Germ Is</span>

life; resembles mold; in size the
smallest living thing that can be
seen with the microscope; in
masses forming the films floating on foul fluids
or covering decomposing animal or vegetable
matter. It consists of a single cell, and its mode
of increase when placed under proper conditions
of growth is by division of the cell body;
the two cells formed out of the first being divided
into four before complete separation has
taken place; the four dividing into eight, the
eight into sixteen, the sixteen into thirty-two,
and so on indefinitely.</p>

<p>Now, as it requires only thirty minutes for
one cell to divide, it has been estimated that a
single bacterium will in twenty-four hours increase
to the number of over sixteen million
five hundred thousand, and in forty-eight hours
to two hundred and eighty-one million five hundred
thousand. At this rate of increase, in three
days there would be a mass of bacteria weighing
about sixteen million pounds. As the multiplication
of bacteria depends upon conditions
that soon interfere with or interrupt their
growth, as the want of food, their own secretions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
and certain natural forces operating
against them, these stupendous figures are useful
only as an illustration of the enormous fertility
of these organisms, and their destructive
energy when they attack a susceptible living
body.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">What</span> is the function of bacteria in the
economy of nature? It would be surprising
if such a menace to human life as
some species of bacteria have proved themselves
to be had no other place among the forces
of nature than to prevent the

<span class="sni">The Function of<br>
Bacteria</span>

too rapid increase of the
human race on this earth, as
our forefathers believed. It
is gratifying, and quite satisfying to a revengeful
spirit, to learn from the modern laboratory that
the special and only function of the bacterium
is to perform the duties of a universal scavenger.
It is always seeking to decompose animal
and vegetable matter. It lives on filth, riots
in it, and dies when deprived of it. It enters
the human body only in search of filth, and if
it finds none it does the person no harm, and
dies either from the want of food or by starvation,
or escapes from the body, or secretes itself
where it may safely await the creation of decomposing
matter, when it will begin its life-work.</p>

<p>Thus, there may be and doubtless is at all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
times a great variety of bacteria of a virulent
type, quiescent in our bodies only for the time
that they find no decaying matter adapted to
their special tastes or wants.</p>

<p>It is a most interesting fact, therefore, that
this most deadly foe of man becomes dangerous
only when the latter is harboring in his body
waste or decomposing matters that are slowly
poisoning him. It is in the process of digesting
this material that the bacterium excretes poisons—toxins—of
the most virulent nature,
which are absorbed into the blood of the human
victim, creating the condition popularly known
as blood poisoning.</p>

<p>Bacteria perform a most important function
in the economy of nature, viz., the conversion
of decaying and dead matter into food for
plants. Biologists assert that without bacteria
plant life on the earth would be scanty or entirely
wanting; they are the natural intermediaries
between plants and animal in point
of food production. They are therefore called
scavengers, because they live on decomposing
matter; but in the very act of digesting such
waste they convert it into products essential to
plant life (carbon dioxide and ammonia) and
by their excretions restore to vegetation its chief
supply of food.</p>

<p>It appears on the same authorities that bacteria
not only assist materially in maintaining
vegetable and animal life on this planet, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
“in the arts and industries they are as essential
to modern economic life as are the ingenious
mechanical inventions of men. Many secret
processes now in use in the arts and manufactures
are but devices to harness these natural
forces. Thus in the manufacture of linen,
hemp, and sponges, in the butter, cheese, and
vinegar industries, in tobacco-curing, etc., bacteria
play an important rôle.”</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">It</span> naturally occurs that to meet the various
conditions under which decomposing matter
exists in nature there is a great variety of
species of bacteria, each species being adapted
to a special field of operations. These species
are distinguished from one

<span class="sni">Bacteria for<br>
Every Condition</span>

another by the shapes they
assume during their growth,
some being rod shaped (the
bacillus), others spherical (the coccus), and
others spiral (the spirillum). Under one of
these divisions the various species are classified.</p>

<p>In these latter days of popular knowledge of
scientific progress, but without precise information
of details, bacteria are associated in the
public mind with disease, especially of the epidemic
form. While this prejudice is useful
in stimulating the people to adopt and enforce
preventive measures against conditions that
tend to promote bacterial life in their homes
and in their own persons, yet it should be understood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
that comparatively few of the great
number and variety of bacteria are pathogenic,
or disease producing, in man.</p>

<p>So throughout the animal kingdom we find
that few are susceptible to a common disease;
or, in other words, that the same species of bacteria
attack in equal force several varieties of
animals.</p>

<p>The explanation of this peculiarity is found
in the variations of the quality or intimate nature
of the tissues and organs of different species
of animals. The same may be said of our
own bodies—the several organs vary greatly
in their susceptibility to the attacks of the different
kinds of bacteria; hence the latter are
classified as specific and nonspecific, according
as they cause specific or nonspecific disease.</p>

<p>The distribution of bacteria is limited only by
the existence of plants and animals; that is, the
existence of decomposing vegetable and animal
matter. Though they are more abundant in the
earth where such matter is found most abundantly,
yet they abound in the air, the water, on
plants, animals, and insects, on our own bodies,
and in every cavity leading to the exterior. As
bacteria are always searching for food, the number
present is a sure indication of the degree of
cleanliness of the thing, individual, or locality
where they are found.</p>

<p>The movements of bacteria from one point
to another are through the medium of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
other mode of conveyance than their own bodies
afford. Thus they are borne by the water, by
vegetation, by animals of every kind, especially
insects, by the air on particles of dust. The
typhoid bacillus, borne in water and milk, has
caused innumerable epidemics of that dreaded
disease.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> tubercle bacillus is borne on the air
through the medium of particles of dust,
and in cities where the victims of tuberculosis
scatter these germs profusely in the
streets, public conveyances, churches, and
places of resort, in the act of

<span class="sni">The Deadly<br>
Tubercle Bacillus</span>

coughing, sneezing, and spitting,
the dust borne on the
winds is a constant and most
fertile source of infection of tuberculosis. In
a city like New York thousands are annually
infected by the dust-borne tubercle bacilli, not
only by inhaling them in the street, but even
more certainly in the quiet of their homes,
where the germ-bearing dust accumulates in
clothing, bedding, carpets, rugs, and upholstered
furniture, and is daily forced into the air of the
living rooms by broom and duster.</p>

<p>Foul as is the air of the unventilated tenements
of the poor, it has been demonstrated
that the dust which saturates the furniture,
carpets, rugs, and hangings of residences of the
wealthy contains sixty per cent of street filth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
An authority says, “The most widely distributed
pathogenic microörganism (disease-causing
bacterium) in the air is the tubercle
bacillus, the cause of consumption and a large
variety of other ailments, such as hipjoint disease,
caries of the spine, etc. Over one hundred
thousand persons die annually from consumption
alone in the United States, and it is estimated
that there are over two million people
afflicted with the disease in one form or another.
All of these sufferers are expectorating
billions of tubercle bacilli daily.”</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">Considering</span> the second inquiry as to how
infection affects the body, we must constantly
bear in mind that a bacterium,
though a scavenger, is a conservator of nature.
Its real function in the orderly processes of
animal and vegetable life is

<span class="sni">How Bacteria<br>
Affect the Body</span>

to utilize waste for the preservation
and promotion of
animal and vegetable life on
this planet where the conditions are so favorable
to both.</p>

<p>Therefore, wherever we find bacteria in the
active processes of growth, that is, multiplication,
we may be assured that they have found
matter that should be rescued from waste and
converted into useful food for plants. It follows
that when we find a bacterium actively growing
in any part of our bodies, it has found some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
form of decaying matter that is not only no
longer useful to our bodies, but is in fact harmful
and should be removed.</p>

<p>It is also important to understand that waste
matter is found under a great variety of conditions,
and that for its proper conversion into
useful food for plants there must be a correspondingly
large number of species of bacteria
each having its special field of operation. It is
due to this variety of bacteria that there are
so many infective diseases; for each species of
bacteria creates its own individual form of disease.</p>

<p>This statement requires the following explanation,
viz., a bacterium in a quiescent state
is harmless; everyone has within his body innumerable
bacteria, as the tubercle and typhoid
bacilli; but they are inert, and hence innocuous.
It is only when they find their proper food, decaying
matter, that they begin to multiply, and
in that act they secret a poison, toxin, which is
absorbed, and, entering the circulation, causes
in the individual a special class of symptoms
peculiar to that toxin, or poison.</p>

<p>These symptoms constitute a disease, the technical
name of which is usually fanciful, depending
on some feature of the symptoms, but explaining
nothing as to its essential nature.</p>

<p>For example, the typhoid bacillus finds its
food in certain minute glands of the small
bowels. If these glands are in a perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
healthy state when the bacillus enters the digestive
tract, the germ will pass over them and
disappear from the body perfectly harmless.
But if the bacillus finds its appropriate food—dead
or decomposing matter—in the glands,
it at once takes up its abode in them and “begins
housekeeping;” that is, it begins to multiply according
to the method of fission of its cell and
rate of multiplication, already described. During
this process the multiplying cells excrete a
toxin, which, being absorbed, creates a fever,
the result of a true blood poisoning. This fever
is called typhoid, because its prominent symptom,
stupor, resembles that of typhus fever.
The name, therefore, signifies nothing as to the
nature of the disease.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> poisoning of the body by the excreted
toxin of the multiplying cells, which is
simply plant food, occurs because it is removed
only in part by the digestive organs, the
circulation that conveys it to the other eliminating
organs being efficient for that

<span class="sni">The Toxin<br>
Secreted</span>

purpose. Could all of this toxin
be removed as fast as it is excreted,
and not enter the circulation, there
would be no fever.</p>

<p>The termination of this process must be either
the death of the colony from exhaustion of the
food supply in the glands, or the exhaustion of
the patient by the excess of toxins that accumulate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
in the body. As the activity of the
bacillus depends upon the food supplied, the
severity and length of the fever varies in different
individuals. Some are immune, because
the glands that furnish the food of the typhoid
bacillus are in a state of high health; others
have a brief and mild attack, because the food
supply is scant owing to a slight impairment
of the integrity of the glands; but with a considerable
number in every epidemic the food is
ample to sustain the creation of an immense
colony of bacilli which destroys the victim by
an overdose of poison.</p>

<p>The final disposition of the typhoid bacilli,
after a course of fever, was believed to be by
their elimination from the body through the
various organs devoted to the discharge of waste
products; but recent investigations have proved
that the typhoid bacillus may remain in the
body for long periods without apparently affecting
the health of the person, but when communicated
to another, it will cause an attack
of fever of the most virulent type. In one instance
an outbreak of typhoid fever was traced
to a woman who had fever upward of fifty
years ago. It was found that the excretions of
her body contained immense quantities of living
typhoid bacilli. She was a cook by trade, and it
was found on tracing her history that wherever
she had worked there had been epidemics of
typhoid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
A still more remarkable feature of the life
history of the typhoid bacillus has recently
been made public. A typhoid epidemic was
traced to a nurse who had attended cases of
typhoid fever, but had never suffered from an
attack of that disease, and yet was discharging
large quantities of the bacilli. These cases can
be explained only on the theory that these
microörganisms find some place, possibly, as
has been suggested, in the gall bladder, where
they find food sufficient to keep them in an
active state of multiplication, but where the conditions
prevent the absorption of the toxins
they excrete.</p>

<p>How far these curious incidents in the life
of the typhoid bacilli are common to other
bacilli is not known; but if it is true of other
infectious diseases, the fact will explain the
origin of those obscure and mysterious cases
that occur without any known exposure to the
infection.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">In</span> concluding this inquiry as to the nature of
infection and its effects on the body, the following
statement of a biologist as to the bacterium
seems justified: “When it enters a living
body, it aims directly at the destruction of the

<span class="sni">Bacteria Aim to<br>
Destroy the Body</span>

latter. It multiplies rapidly, tends to scatter its
broods throughout the tissues, and all the while
gives off the most powerful poisons. This agent
is wickedly implacable, neither giving nor asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
quarter. The battle that it wages with the
body can terminate only
by the destruction of one of
the combatants.”</p>

<p>Viewed in the light of the
past history of infectious diseases, this
is not an overdrawn picture. If we estimate
the deaths from smallpox in ancient
times, from cholera in modern times,
and from tuberculosis (consumption) throughout
all time, the destruction of human life by
bacteria cannot be overstated. The bacterium
has been a wickedly implacable foe to the human
race in the past. Invisible, intangible,
everywhere present, it has proved omnipotent
in its destructive attacks upon communities.</p>

<p>But our century opens with a far brighter
outlook for the race. Elementary forces which,
through ignorance of their true functions in the
economy and conservation of nature, were permitted
in the past to expend their energy in the
destruction of life, have been revealed by
science to be man’s most helpful agents in the
promotion of comfort, health, and longevity.
Electricity was for ages only a thunderbolt, an
object of terror, and an agent of destruction,
visiting the human residence only to kill its
owner and burn the structure.</p>

<p>To-day the same natural force is man’s most
obedient and humble servant, quietly visiting
his home to furnish him heat and light, annihilating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
time in the transactions of business, and
transporting him from place to place as on the
lightning’s wings.</p>

<p>So the bacterium, once the terror of mankind
as the invisible and apparently unknowable
cause of devastating pestilences, proves to be
the useful purveyor of the by-products of man’s
digestion of waste matter which is thereby converted
into food for plants. It visits man in the
pursuit of its humble calling to obtain his contribution
to the sum total of plant food. It
searches every tissue, every organ, every recess,
however obscure, but so stealthily that its coming
and going and its immediate presence are
not known if absolute cleanliness of the body
exists. It is only when dying tissues or organs,
or accumulations of dead matter, are found that
its presence becomes known. Even then it
would prove harmless and its presence would
be unrecognized if its excretions of plant food
(toxins) were not necessarily absorbed and did
not enter the circulation, thus poisoning the
body it is relieving of dead matter.</p>

<p class="section b"><span class="dc">Briefly,</span> what are man’s defenses against
bacteria? Chiefly two, viz., first, killing it
by depriving it of food; and, second, killing
it directly by what are known as germicides.
The first method is effected by cleanliness of

<span class="sni">Man’s<br>
Defenses</span>

the person. It may be affirmed that cleanliness,
without and within, absolutely protects every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
man, woman, and child from the most common
disease-producing bacteria.</p>

<p>It is not sufficient to keep the skin
clean by daily baths, while the
mouth, nose, throat, and other
internal surfaces and organs are covered
or filled with effete matter. We must be every
whit clean if we would escape the results of
the scavenging processes of bacteria of some
variety or species.</p>

<p>That condition can be secured and maintained
in an organism that itself is constantly
decaying in all of its tissues and organs only by
strict compliance with the natural laws governing
the operations of the body as an independent
organism in which all of its forces tend to promote
its health and conservation. Every tissue
and every organ has its special means of renewal
of its tissue by the removal of dead particles
through the outlets and the reception of
fresh material through the inlets of the body.
Waste and supply are exactly balanced, as in
the most precise and delicate machine. If the
outlets become clogged, so that all the waste
cannot escape at that proper time, dead matter,
the food of bacteria, begins to accumulate, and
disease must result.</p>

<p>In the same manner, if the food is in excess
of the demands, or of a quality not suited to the
needs of the tissue or organ, waste begins to
accumulate, bacteria swarm in the decomposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
mass, and emit their toxins, which, absorbed
into the circulation, cause a variety of physical
disturbances according to the species of bacteria
present, and the particular tissues the
toxins affect, as the nervous system, stomach,
heart, kidneys, etc.</p>

<p>That even the most feeble minded may be
able to regulate their habits so as to secure an
adequate supply of food both in quality and
quantity, and the prompt removal of waste
matter, so as to secure that degree of cleanliness
of internal organs essential to escape from bacterial
attacks, the mechanism of the body is endowed
with instincts that make it automatic in
its action. Such are appetite and taste for food
and drinks; the desire for exercise, rest, and
sleep; the impulse of the organs in an active
state, etc. It is only when these natural
monitors are interfered with that the mechanism
begins to fail in its elimination of waste,
and bacteria find the conditions favorable for
their functional activity.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> second defensive measure is the destruction
of the bacteria by means of agents that
will destroy the microörganism before or
after its entrance into the body, but without injuring
the healthy tissues. There is a great variety

<span class="sni">Destroy the<br>
Bacteria</span>

of these agents of more or less power, and
they are used in the form of gases, liquids, and
powders, according to conditions existing in individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
cases. In general, it may be advised
that, as bacteria are everywhere,
germicides ought to be used far
more extensively than they
are for the purposes of securing
not only the direct destruction of bacteria,
but of removing or neutralizing dead matter,
the food of bacteria.
So minute are bacteria, and so adherent are
they to material things, that mere bathing with
water does not remove them, medicate it as we
may with fancy soaps. There should be used
in addition a more penetrating and destructive
agent, which would not only destroy all forms
of bacteria, but at the same time secure absolute
cleanliness.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">It</span> would be impossible even to summarize, except
in a volume, the vast number of so-called
germicides that have been brought to the attention
of the public for use; but in the practice
of surgery the chief reliance is placed upon

<span class="sni">The Value of<br>
Germicides</span>

those agents which simply oxidize
organic matter, and thus
destroy the germ without injuring
living tissue, as do all forms
of caustic preparations. The saving of life by
these new measures far exceeds that effected by
simply removing the material that contains the
germ, without destroying the germ itself.</p>

<p>It is impossible to estimate the resources of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
science in its efforts to discover the ultimate
conditions that govern the origin and spread of
all the pestilential diseases; but its revelations
during the last quarter of a century are a
prophecy and a promise that the whole brood
of domestic contagious and infectious diseases
will disappear during the present century from
the homes of English-speaking people; largely
because the lessons of cleanliness are being
learned, not only the lessons of cleanliness of
the home, but also personal cleanliness—a
form of cleanliness that is more than washing
with soap and water,—that kind of cleanliness
which kills germs, removes the substances in
which they live, and disinfects and makes
aseptic and healthy the surrounding tissues.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case left4">“Cleanliness</span> is indeed next to
Godliness,” is an oft-quoted
saying of John Wesley. Bacon
stated the maxim thus: “Cleanness
of body was ever deemed
to proceed from a due reverence
to God.” The Hebrew Fathers,
from whom this sanitary principle was derived,
resolved the doctrines of religion into “Carefulness;
Carefulness into Vigorousness;
Vigorousness into
Guiltlessness; Guiltlessness
into Abstemiousness; Abstemiousness
into Cleanliness; Cleanliness into
Godliness.”</p>

<p>This religious creed was doubtless based on
the Mosaic sanitary code, and was the preventive
measure against pestilences which the

<span class="sni">Cleanliness Next<br>
to Godliness</span>

great Jewish law-giver approved. How generally
and how long the “Chosen People”
adopted and practised this method of protection
against epidemic diseases does not appear, but
it is quite certain that in later days it had been
discarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">The</span> Hebrew Fathers could have had no conception
of the invisible agencies in filth that
made uncleanness such a powerful factor in
the propogation of epidemic pestilences and
domestic contagious and infectious diseases. It
was reserved for the scientists

<span class="sni">Invisible Agencies<br>
in Filth</span>

of the recent past to
discover the exact nature
of the infective germs of
communicable diseases, their origin, their development,
their modes of infection; in other
words, their life history.</p>

<p>This discovery revealed the fact that filth in
every form, whether in the rubbish-heap, the
toilet, the garbage, the dust of the floor, or even
in the folds of the hands and feet, the secretions
of the skin and glands, is a culture bed for germ-producing
diseases. The secret of the great
power of cleanness as the true remedial measure
for the prevention of pestilences is now apparent
and every citizen must recognize that the
obligation of applying that remedy rests with
himself.</p>

<p>The Great Awakening, in the middle of the
last century, of the people of England, and subsequently,
of this country, to the intimate relations
of filth, in all forms in and around their
dwellings, to the prevalence and fatality of
cholera, typhus fever, and other communicable
diseases, has restored cleanliness to its ancient
imperial position as chief of the virtues, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
the most reliable private and public means of
conserving health.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="dc">This</span> awakening, due both in England and
America to trivial incidents, forms one of
the most interesting chapters in human history.
