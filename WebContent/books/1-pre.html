</div>

<p><i>The story of a great life-saving social revolution,
    the mightiest in the nineteenth century and one
    of the most momentous in the history of civilization,
    is told here for the first time. It is told from the
    standpoint of the transformation of the City of New
    York, by a chief actor in the event.</i></p>

<p><i>Only by forcing ourselves into a receptive mood
    can we of the present credit the half of what is set
    before us concerning The City That Was. The
    shocked imagination rebels. It seeks relief in assuming
    that even a trained expert, a contemporaneous
    witness and investigator of the conditions described,
    in writing after they have passed away, unconsciously
    yields to the historian’s temptation to throw the past
    into dramatic relief by starting exaggerations.</i></p>

<p><i>Dr. Smith, however, leaves us no room for doubt.
    The appalling chapter in which he lays bare the New
    York of 1864 is a contemporaneous document. It is a
    physician’s report of a systematic medical inspection
    of New York in that year, as delivered before a Legislative
    Committee a few months later by the very physician
    who had directed the inspection.</i></p>

<p><i>Nevertheless, The City That Was is not New York
    alone. She is but a type. Her condition, with variations,
    may be multiplied, during the early years of
    the nineteenth century, by the total of the cities,
    towns, and villages in the world. In the work of
    regeneration some of these anticipated her. Others,
    including all throughout the territory of the United
    States, were aroused through her agitation and inspired
    by her example.</i></p>

<p><i>As a student of local history, the writer thought
    himself familiar with the many phases of the growth
    of New York; but the condition of the City as late
    as the period of our Civil War, as here depicted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
    startled him as might a revelation. He believes that
    no seriously minded man or woman can afford to
    ignore this volume. We owe it to ourselves and to
    one another fully to face its lesson.</i></p>

<p><i>We shall be shocked; we shall be filled with horror;
    but accepting the city that now is, great as her faults
    may be, with a new gratitude, we shall turn with
    anointed sympathy and understanding to any earnest
    voice that pleads for the city that should be. And,
    indeed, other volumes which Dr. Smith himself has in
    preparation, as suggestive and as interesting as this
    one, may help us on in this direction.</i></p>
