<h1 title="">ROME</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I</span>
    <br><span class="h2line2">INTRODUCTORY</span></h2>
<p>Let us suppose an ordinary Englishman,
    with no special knowledge of classical history,
    to be looking at a collection of Roman antiquities
    in the cases of a museum. He will
    probably not linger long over these cases, but
    will pass on to something more likely to
    attract his interest. The objects he is looking
    at are, for the most part, neither striking
    nor beautiful, and the same are presented for
    his inspection over and over again as collections
    from various Roman sites. They
    are chiefly useful things, implements and
    utensils of all kinds, and fragments of military
    weapons and armour. In the coins he can
    take no delight, because, apart from the fact
    that, uninterpreted, they have no tale to tell
    him, they do not excite his admiration by
    beauty of design and workmanship. If, indeed,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
    he were visiting a museum at Rome, he
    would find plenty of beautiful things in it;
    but these are works of Greek artists, imported
    by wealthy or tasteful Romans in the later
    ages of Rome’s history. A typical collection
    of genuine Roman antiquities would probably
    have the effect I describe. Utility, not
    beauty, would seem to have been the motive of
    the people who left these things behind them.</p>
<p>The same motive will also be suggested to
    us if we visit any of the larger Roman works
    either in this country or on the Continent.
    Most of us know the look of a Roman road
    running straight over hill and valley, and
    meant mainly for military purposes, to enable
    troops to move rapidly and to survey the
    country as they marched. In the towns which
    have been excavated, we usually find that the
    most spacious and striking buildings must
    have been the meeting-halls (<i>basilicæ</i>), in
    which business of all kinds was transacted,
    and especially business connected with law
    and government. Very often, though not in
    the comparatively poor province of Britain,
    this characteristic of utility is combined with
    another—solidity and imposing size. In this
    well-watered island the Romans did not need
    <span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
    aqueducts to bring a constant supply of
    water to their towns, but in Italy and the
    south of France these great works are sometimes
    unnecessarily huge and imposing. Even
    when they left the path of strict utility, as in
    their triumphal arches and gateways, for
    which we must go to Trier in Germany, or to
    Orange in the south of France, or to Italy itself,
    they held strongly to the principles of
    solidity and imposing size. A writer who
    knew their art well has said that their notion
    of the highest of all things, their <i>summum
        bonum</i>, was not the beautiful, but the powerful,
    and that they thought they had as a
    people received this notion from heaven.</p>
<p>It would, indeed, be wrong to say that there
    is no beauty in Roman art; but it is quite in
    accordance with what has just been said,
    that even in the best of it there is a strong
    tendency to realism, to matter of fact. In
    their sculpture they were especially strong in
    portraiture, and in depicting scenes of human
    life they never or rarely idealise. A battle
    scene, or a picture on stone of life in a city,
    is crowded with figures, just because it really
    was so, and the work is without that restfulness
    for the eye which the perfect grouping
    <span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
    of a Greek artist so often supplies. So, too,
    in literature; all their greatest poetry has a
    strictly practical object, and bears directly on
    human life. The great philosophical poem of
    Lucretius was meant to rescue the Romans
    from religious superstition; the object of the
    <i>Æneid</i> of Virgil, of which I shall have more
    to say in another chapter, was to recall the
    degenerate Roman of that day to the sense
    of duty in the home and in the State. Their
    one original invention in literary form was
    satire, by which they meant comment,
    friendly or hostile, on the human life around
    them. Their myths and legends, of which
    there was no such abundant crop as in Greece,
    dealt chiefly with the founding of cities, or
    with the heroic deeds of human beings.<a class="fn" id="fr_1"
                                             href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_1">[1]</a>
    On
    the whole they excelled most in oratory and
    history; and their prose came to perfection
    earlier than their poetry.</p>
<p>One other feature of their character shall be
    mentioned here, which is entirely in keeping
    with the rest, and often escapes notice. If in
    the works of their hands and their brains they
    <span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
    were not an imaginative people, we can well
    understand that they had not this gift in
    practical life. Imagination in action takes
    the form of adventurousness, as we may see
    in our own history; the literary imaginativeness
    of Elizabethan England has its counterpart
    in the adventurous voyages of Elizabethan
    seamen. The Romans were not an
    adventurous people; they were not imaginative
    enough to be so. They penetrated, indeed,
    into unknown countries; Cæsar reached
    Britain and bridged the Rhine, but that great
    man, a true Roman born, had a temperament
    rather scientific than romantic. He did as
    almost all conquering Romans had done
    before him, and were to do after him—he
    advanced solidly, making his way safe behind
    him and feeling carefully in front of him.
    His book about his wars in Gaul was written
    without a touch of imagination, and for
    strictly practical purposes. There is, indeed,
    in the generation before Cæsar, an exception
    so striking that it may be said to prove the
    rule; he who reads Plutarch’s charming life
    of Sertorius, an Italian from the mountains
    of central Italy, will find both romance and
    adventure in his story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>It is plain, then, that we have to do in this
    volume with a people not of imagination, but
    of action: a people intensely alive to the
    necessities and difficulties of human life.
    The Romans were, in fact, the most practical
    people in history; and this enabled them to
    supply what was wanting to the civilisation
    of the Mediterranean basin in the work of
    the Greeks. They themselves were well aware
    of this quality, and proud of it. We find it
    expressed by the elder Cato quite at the beginning
    of the best age of Roman literature;
    his ideal Roman is <i>vir fortis et strenuus</i>—a man
    of strong courage and active energy. Tacitus,
    in the later days of that literature, says that
    all designs and deeds should be directed to
    the practical ends of life (<i>ad utilitatem vitæ</i>).
    Midway between these two, we have the great
    Latin poets constantly singing of the hardihood
    and the practical virtues which had
    made Rome great, and Italy great under
    Rome’s leadership. “A race of hardy breed,
    we carry our children to the streams and
    harden them in the bitter, icy water; as boys
    they spend wakeful nights over the chase,
    and tire out the whirlwind, but in manhood,
    unwearied by toil and trained to poverty,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
    they subdue the soil with their mattocks, or
    shake towns in war” (Virg., <i>Æn.</i> ix. 607 foll.).
    These lines, though applied to an Italian
    stock, were meant to remind the Roman of
    a life that had once been his. The words in
    which the Romans delighted as expressing
    their national characteristics, all tell the same
    tale: <i>gravitas</i>, the seriousness of demeanour
    which is the outward token of a steadfast
    purpose; <i>continentia</i>, self-restraint; <i>industria</i>
    and <i>diligentia</i>, words which we have inherited
    from them, needing no explanation;
    <i>constantia</i>, perseverance in conduct; and last,
    not least, <i>virtus</i>, manliness, which originally
    meant activity and courage, and with ripening
    civilisation took on a broader and more
    ethical meaning. Quotations might be multiplied
    a thousandfold to prove the honest
    admiration of this people for their own nobler
    qualities. As exemplified in an individual,
    Plutarch’s life of the elder Cato, which can be
    read as well in English as in the original
    Greek, will give a good idea of these.</p>
<p>But it is essential to note that this hard
    and practical turn of the Roman mind was
    in some ways curiously limited. It cannot
    be said that they excelled either in industrial
    <span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
    or commercial pursuits. Agriculture was
    their original occupation, and trade-gilds existed
    at Rome very early in her history; but
    the story of their agriculture is rather a sad
    one, and Rome has never become a great industrial
    city. Their first book about husbandry
    was translated from the Carthaginian,
    and their methods of commerce they learnt
    chiefly from the Greeks. It was in another
    direction that their genius for practical work
    drew them: to the arts and methods of discipline,
    law, government.</p>
<p>We can see this peculiar gift showing itself
    at all stages of their development: in the
    agricultural family which was the germ of
    all their later growth, in the city-state which
    grew from that germ, and in the Empire,
    founded by the leaders of the city-state, and
    organised by Augustus and his successors.
    It is seen, too, in their military system, which
    won them their empire; they did not fight
    merely for spoil or glory, but for clearly
    realised practical purposes. As Tacitus says
    of a single German tribe which possessed
    something of this gift, the Romans did not
    so much go out to battle as to war. True,
    they constantly made blunders and suffered
    <span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
    defeat; they often “muddled through” difficulties
    as we do ourselves; but they refused to
    recognise defeat, and profited by adverse
    fortune. Listen once more to a few words
    of old Cato; in his <i>Origins of Rome</i>, written
    for his son, he wrote: “Adversity tames us,
    and teaches us our true line of conduct, while
    good fortune is apt to warp us from the way
    of prudence.” Thus they went on from
    defeat to victory, conquest, and government.
    It is worth while not only to lay to heart, but
    to learn by heart, the famous lines in which
    Virgil sums up the Roman’s conception of
    his own work in the world—</p>
<div class="verse">
    <p class="t0">“Others will mould their bronzes to breathe with a tenderer grace,</p>
    <p class="t0">Draw, I doubt not, from marble a vivid life to the face,</p>
    <p class="t0">Plead at the bar more deftly, with sapient wands of the wise,</p>
    <p class="t0">Trace heaven’s courses and changes, predict us stars to arise.</p>
    <p class="t0">Thine, O Roman, remember, to reign over every race!</p>
    <p class="t0">These be thine arts, thy glories, the ways of peace to proclaim,</p>
    <div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
    <p class="t0">Mercy to show to the fallen, the proud with battle to tame!”</p>
    <p class="lr"><i>Æneid</i>, vi. 847-853</p>
    <p class="lr">(Bowen’s translation).</p>
</div>
<p>It was this power of ruling, which itself
    implies a habit of discipline, that marked out
    Rome as the natural successor of Greece in
    European civilisation; and it grew naturally
    out of the purely practical bent of the early
    Romans, who were unhampered in their constant
    activity by fancy, reflection, or culture.
    Without it, we may doubt if the work of the
    Greeks would have been saved for us when
    the storms from the north, invasions of barbarian
    peoples, fell at last upon the sunny
    lands filled with the spirit of Greek thought
    and the divine works of Greek artists. To
    Roman discipline, law, and government, we
    owe not only much that even now is every
    day of practical benefit to us, but the preservation
    of what we still possess of the treasures
    of Hellenic genius.</p>
<p>For this reason I assume that this book
    will be taken up by most readers after they
    have made some acquaintance with the history
    and thought of the Greeks. It is true
    <span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
    that the history of the two peoples is best
    looked at as one great whole; there is a
    general likeness in their institutions; the form
    of the State, and the ideas of government,
    with which each grew to maturity, were in
    the main the same. But Roman mental
    development was much slower than Greek;
    and Greece was already beginning to lose
    her vitality when Rome was still illiterate
    and unable to record her own history adequately.
    Thus Greek influence was the first
    to tell upon the world; the basin of the
    Mediterranean was already permeated by the
    Greek spirit when Roman influence began to
    work upon it; and there can be no doubt
    that he who begins with Roman history
    and then goes on to Greek is reversing the
    natural order of things.</p>
<p>I will also assume that those who have
    begun to read this book are provided with
    some knowledge of that Mediterranean basin
    which is the scene of Græco-Roman history;
    such as can be gained by frequent
    contemplation of a good map. They will be
    familiar with Sicily and south Italy, which
    were teeming with Greek settlements when
    Roman history really begins. They will
    <span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
    probably have realised how short a step it is
    from Italy to Africa, whether or no Sicily
    be taken as a stepping-stone; Cato could
    show fresh figs in the Roman senate which
    had been grown in Carthaginian territory.
    They will have realised that you can pass
    from the “heel” of Italy to the Hellenic
    peninsula in a single night, as Cæsar did when
    he embarked his army at Brindisi to attack
    his rival; such geographical facts are of immense
    importance in explaining not only the
    foreign policy of Rome, but also the development
    of her culture. And thus furnished,
    they will begin to be curious about the destiny
    of the Italian peninsula, of which Greek
    history has had little to tell them. Leaving
    that question for the present, they will wish
    to know why the Greeks did not colonise the
    centre and north of Italy as they did the
    south and south-west, but left room enough
    for a new type of civilisation to grow up there.
    And above all, they will wish to know how
    and why a single city on the western coast
    should have succeeded in building up a great
    power in Italy quite independent of Greece,
    and destined eventually to supersede her,
    which may be reckoned as a factor almost as
    <span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
    important in the making of our modern civilisation
    as Hellas herself.</p>
<p>This last question is the one which I must
    try to answer in the earlier part of this book;
    in the later chapters I shall have to deal with
    another one—how this single city-state contrived
    to weld together the whole Mediterranean
    civilisation, strongly enough to
    give it several centuries of security against
    uncivilised enemies in the north, and half-civilised
    enemies in the east. But for the
    moment let us see why the Greeks did not
    permeate Italy with their own civilisation
    as they did Sicily: how it was that they left
    room for a new power, capable eventually
    of shielding them and their work from destruction.
    To answer this question we must
    consider the nature of the Italian peninsula,
    and the character of the races then living
    in it.</p>
<p>The simple fact is, that though the shrewd
    commercial Greek had seized on all the best
    harbours in the long, narrow peninsula, these
    harbours were all in the south coast, about
    the “heel” of Italy, or in the south-west
    coast, in the volcanic region of the modern
    Naples, which was itself one of these Greek
    <span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
    settlements. The east coast north of the
    “heel” is almost harbourless, as will be
    realised by any one who takes the route by
    rail to Brindisi on his way to Egypt or India.
    <i>Italy is a mountainous country</i>—a fact never
    to be forgotten in Roman history—and its
    mountains, the long chain of the Apennines,
    have their spinal ridge much nearer the east
    than the west coast, and descend upon the
    sea so sharply on that side that for long
    distances road or railway only just finds a
    passage. All along this east coast there was
    nothing to tempt Greeks to settle, and as they
    rarely or never penetrated far inland from
    their settlements, their influence never spread
    into this mountainous region from the many
    seacoast towns of Magna Græcia, as their part
    of Italy was called. On the Bay of Naples
    they had, indeed, a better chance; here there
    was a rich fertile plain stretching away to the
    hills, which on this side come down less steeply
    than on the eastern; this we shall hear of
    again as the Plain of Campania, in which
    Greek influence was very strong and active,
    capable of penetrating beyond its limits
    northward. But north of this again they left
    no permanent settlements; good harbours are
    <span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
    wanting, and such as there are were occupied
    about the eighth century <span class="small">B.C.</span> by a people at
    that time as enterprising as themselves, the
    Etruscans. These, too, had been recent immigrants
    into the peninsula from the east, and
    together with the Greeks they formed the only
    obstacles to the growth of a native Italian
    power—a power, that is, belonging to the
    older races that had long been settled there.
    The Greeks were not likely to interfere with
    such a growth, as we have seen; whether
    the Etruscans were to do so we have yet to
    see.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, this Etruscan people who
    first gave an Italian stock the chance of
    rising into a great Mediterranean power; and
    in order to understand how this was, we must
    look at a good map of central Italy, which
    gives a fair idea of the elevations in this part
    of the peninsula. Looking at such a map,
    it is easy to see that the long, narrow leg of
    Italy is cloven in twain about the middle by
    a river, the Tiber, the only river of considerable
    size and real historical importance, south
    of the Po. It is formed of several streams
    which descend from the central mass of the
    Apennines, now called the Abruzzi, but soon
    <span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
    gathers into a swift though not a wide river,
    and emerges from that mountainous district
    some five-and-twenty miles from the sea,
    into what we now call the Roman Campagna,
    the Latium of ancient times; skirting the
    northern edge of this comparatively level
    district it falls into the sea, without forming
    a natural harbour, about half-way up the
    western coast of the peninsula. To the north
    of it and of the plain were settled a number of
    cities, more or less independent of each other,
    forming the Etruscan people, whose origin we
    do not yet know for certain, and whose language
    has never been deciphered from the
    inscriptions they have left behind them; a
    mysterious race, active in war and commerce,
    who had subdued but not exterminated the
    native population around them. To the east
    and south of the Tiber, stretching far along
    the mountainous region and its western outskirts,
    was a race of hardy mountaineers,
    broken up, as hill peoples usually are, into
    a number of communities without any principle
    of cohesion except that of the various
    tribes to which they belonged. The northern
    part of this sturdy hill-folk was known as
    Umbrians and Sabines; the southern part as
    <span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
    Samnites or Oscans. They all spoke dialects
    of the same tongue, a tongue akin to those
    which most European peoples still speak.
    Lastly, immediately to the south of the Tiber
    in the last part of its course, occupying
    the plain which stretches here between the
    mountains, the river, and the sea, there was
    settled another branch of this same stock,
    speaking another dialect destined to be known
    for ever as Latin. These three sub-races of a
    great stock—Umbrians, Samnites, and Latins—are
    meant when we speak of a native Italian
    population as opposed to Greek or Etruscan
    immigrants. Doubtless they were not the
    aboriginal inhabitants of the country, but of
    older stocks history knows nothing that concerns
    us in this book. These are the peoples
    who were destined to be supreme in the
    Mediterranean basin, and eventually to
    govern the whole civilised world.</p>
<p>It is as well to be quite clear at once that
    the acquisition of this supremacy was not
    the work of one only of these peoples, the
    Latins, or of one city only of the Latins,
    <i>i.e.</i> Rome. It was the work of all these
    stocks which I have called native Italian.
    Roman is a convenient word, and Rome was
    <span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
    all along the leader in action and the organising
    power; but the material, and in a great
    part as time went on the brain-power also,
    was contributed by all these peoples taken
    together. They had first to submit to the
    great leader and organiser, Rome, a fate
    against which, as we shall see, they struggled
    long; but no sooner had they submitted than
    they were added to the account of Italian
    development, and with few exceptions played
    their new part with a good courage.</p>
<p>So much, then, for the Italian peoples who
    were to supersede the Greeks in the world’s
    history. But let us now return for a moment
    to the Tiber, and fix our eyes on the last
    five-and-twenty miles of its course, where it
    separates the plain of Latium from the
    Etruscan people to the north. The Latin-speaking
    stock were far more in danger from
    these Etruscans than the Umbrian and
    Samnite mountaineers; nothing but the river
    was between them and their enemies, for
    enemies they undoubtedly were, bent on pushing
    farther south, like the Danes in England
    in the ninth century of our era. The Latins
    had, indeed, a magnificent natural fortress in
    the middle of their plain, in the extinct
    <span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
    volcano of the Alban mountain, some 3000
    feet above sea-level; and here, according to
    a sure tradition, was their original chief city,
    Alba Longa. But this was of no avail against
    an invader from the north; it was the river
    that was the vital concern of Latium when
    once the Etruscans had become established
    to the north of it. Now at one point, some
    twenty miles by water from the river’s mouth,
    was a group of small hills, rising to a height
    of about 160 feet, three of them almost
    isolated and abutting on the stream, and the
    others in reality a part of the plain to the
    south, with their northern sides falling somewhat
    steeply towards the Tiber. Here, too,
    was an island in the river, which might give
    an enemy an easy chance of crossing. On
    this position there arose at some uncertain
    date, but beyond doubt as a fortress against
    the Etruscan power, a city called <i>Roma</i>; and
    there a city has been ever since, known by
    the same name. It is likely enough that it
    was an outpost founded by the city of Alba
    Longa, which eventually itself vanished out
    of history; and this was the tradition of later
    days. If we can accept the motive of the
    foundation—the defence of Latium against
    <span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
    her foe, we need not trouble about the many
    legends of it.</p>
<p>Rome started on her wonderful career as
    a military outpost of a people akin to her,
    and face to face with an enemy with whom she
    had no sort of relationship. If she could but
    hold her position there was obviously a great
    future for her. The position on the Tiber
    was, in fact, strategically the best in Italy.
    It is, as a great Roman historian said, just in
    the centre of the peninsula. There was easy
    access to the sea both by land and water, and
    a way open into central Italy up the Tiber
    valley—the one great natural entrance from
    the sea. She was far enough from the sea
    to be safe from raiders, yet near enough to
    be in communication with other peoples by
    means of shipping. If enemies attacked her
    from different directions inland, she could
    move against them on what in military language
    we may call “inner lines”—she could
    strike simultaneously from a common base.
    From the sea no power dared attack her,
    until in her degenerate days Genseric landed
    at Ostia in <span class="small">A.D.</span> 455. On the whole, we may
    say that no other city in Italy had the same
    chance, as regards position, of dominating
    <span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
    the whole of Italy, and that in those early
    days of her history the Etruscans unwittingly
    taught her how to use this great advantage.
    Just as the kingdom of the West Saxons, and
    their supremacy in England, was built up by
    the stern necessity of having to resist the
    Danes, so the Romans became a leading
    people in Italy by virtue of having to withstand
    the Etruscans.</p>
<p>In my next chapter I propose to tell the
    story in outline (and in detail it cannot be
    told for want of knowledge) of the advance
    of the Roman power to the leadership of
    Italy. Then I will try and explain the
    qualities and the organisation which enabled
    her to turn her chances to account.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
    <br><span class="h2line2">THE ADVANCE OF ROME IN ITALY</span></h2>
<p>I said in the last chapter that if Rome could
    only hold the line of the lower Tiber against
    the Etruscans, great possibilities of advance
    were open to her. How long she held it we do
    not know; but there is hardly a doubt that in
    course of time—some time probably in the
    sixth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>—she lost it, and even herself
    fell into the hands of the enemy. The tale
    is not told in her legendary annals; but we
    have other convincing evidence. The last
    three kings of Rome seem to have been
    Etruscans. The great temple of Jupiter on
    the Capitoline hill, which was founded at this
    time, was in the Etruscan style, and built on
    foundations of Etruscan masonry, some of
    which can still be seen in the garden of the
    German embassy in modern Rome. Below
    this temple, as you go to the river, was a
    street called the street of the Etruscans, and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
    there are other signs of the conquest which
    need not be given here. On the whole we may
    believe that this persistent enemy crossed the
    Tiber higher up, where she already had a
    footing, and so took the city in flank and
    rear.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Etruscans were not in the
    habit of destroying the cities they took: they
    occupied and made use of them. They seem
    to have used Rome to spread their influence
    over Latium: they built a temple of Jupiter
    on the Alban hill, the old centre of a Latin
    league: and there is strong evidence that they
    made Rome the head of another and later
    league, with a religious centre in a temple of
    Diana, who was not originally a Roman
    deity, on the Aventine hill overlooking the
    Tiber. All events in this Etruscan period
    are very dim and doubtful, but it looks as if
    the very loss of the line of defence had only
    given the conquered city a new lease of life,
    with a widened outlook and fresh opportunities.
    But was she to continue as an
    Etruscan city? The question reminds us of
    a crisis in our own history: was England to
    become a Norman-French country after the
    Conquest?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>At this time it seems that the Etruscans
    were being harassed from the north by Gallic
    tribes, who had already spread over northwest
    Europe, and were conquering the valley
    of the Po and pressing farther south. This
    may account for the undoubted fact that
    about the end of the sixth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>
    Rome did succeed in throwing off the Etruscan
    yoke: that the old Roman families united
    to expel their foreign king, and to establish
    an aristocratic republic. Henceforward the
    very name of king (<i>rex</i>) was held in abhorrence
    by the Romans, and the government
    passed into the hands of two yearly elected
    magistrates, with absolute power as leaders in
    war, and a limited power within the city. In
    the next chapter I will explain this new form
    of government more fully: here it will be
    enough to say that they were called consuls,
    and that they had an advising body (as
    the kings probably had before them) of the
    heads of noble families, called <i>senatus</i>, or
    a body of elderly men. At present let us
    go on with the story of Rome’s advance in
    Italy.</p>
<p>According to the legend, the Etruscans
    made a vigorous attempt to recover Rome.
    <span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
    This is a picturesque story, and is admirably
    told in one of Macaulay’s famous <i>Lays of
        Ancient Rome</i>. But we must pass it over here,
    for we have no means of testing the truth of it.
    Soon afterwards we come upon what seems to
    be a real historical fact, a treaty between
    Rome and the other Latin cities, the text of
    which was preserved for many centuries.
    This treaty shows plainly that henceforward
    we have to reckon Rome and Latium as one
    power in Italy; and this is the first real
    forward step in the advance of Rome. It
    guaranteed in the first place mutual support
    in war; Rome needed support against the
    Etruscans, and the Latin cities at the southern
    end of the plain were liable to be attacked
    by hill tribes from the east and south. Still
    more important as showing the advance of
    civilisation was the sanction of a common
    system of private law. Any citizen of a Latin
    city (including, of course, Rome ) was to be
    able to buy and sell, to hold and inherit
    property, in any other city, in full confidence
    that he would be protected by the law of that
    city in so doing; and if he married a woman
    of another city his marriage was legitimate
    and his children could inherit his property
    <span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
    according to law.<a class="fn" id="fr_2"
                        href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_2">[2]</a> This was going a
    long
    way towards making a single state of the
    whole of Latium. All the communities were
    on equal terms, and all had certain legal
    relations with each other; and these are two
    of the chief features of a true federation. Now
    all federations were an improvement on the
    isolation of the single city-state, which was
    helpless in those days of turbulence and
    invasion. This one looks like the work of a
    statesman; and if that statesman was a
    Roman, Spurius Cassius, as tradition asserted,
    then Rome had achieved her first victory in
    the arts of statesmanship and diplomacy
    with which she was destined to rule the world.</p>
<p>Before we go on with our story let us notice
    how well Latium was geographically fitted to
    develop a federation, as compared with the
    more mountainous districts of Italy. Latium
    was a plain, as its name seems to imply; and
    like Bœotia in Greece it was naturally suited
    for federative union, while tribes living in
    the highlands always found it difficult to
    unite. Again, the Latins were jammed into a
    <span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
    comparatively small space between the hills
    and the sea, and their strength was concentrated
    by their position: while the Etruscans,
    and the various Italian stocks, were continually
    moving onward to look for better
    quarters, and losing their strength and their
    cohesion in doing so.</p>
<p>In these early federations of cities there was
    always a tendency for one particular city to
    slip into the position of leader, just as in
    modern federations, that of Switzerland for
    example, there is a continual tendency for the
    central authority to extend its influence. In
    Latium there can be no doubt that Rome
    very soon began to assume some kind of
    headship. Her position on the Tiber, and the
    constant strain that she had to undergo in resisting
    the Etruscans, gave her an advantage
    over the other Latin cities, who had to resist
    less constant annoyance from less highly
    civilised enemies. I mean that the Roman
    people had both nerve and brain so continually
    exercised that they developed not only
    brute courage, but endurance, diplomatic
    skill and forethought. For a whole century
    after they expelled their Etruscan kings they
    had to keep up a continual struggle with the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
    great Etruscan city of Veii, which was only a
    few miles to the north of the river, on very
    high ground, and with the smaller town of
    Fidenæ on the Tiber above Rome, which the
    Veians could make use of to attack them from
    that side. No wonder that when at last they
    succeeded in taking Veii they burnt it to the
    ground. It is said that they thought of
    migrating to that lofty site themselves, and
    abandoning the position on the Tiber; but
    they wisely gave up the idea, and Veii was
    sacked and her goddess Juno brought to
    Rome. The site is a deserted spot at the
    present day.</p>
<p>It was this prolonged struggle, in which the
    Latins were of course called upon to help, that
    placed Rome in the position of leader of the
    league, and from the moment it was over we
    find her attitude towards the Latins a changed
    one. It is likely enough that she had long
    been growing overbearing and unpopular
    with the other cities, but of this, if it was
    so, we have no certain details. What we
    do know is that at the beginning of the
    fourth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>, when a terrible disaster
    overtook Rome, the Latins failed to serve
    her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>This disaster was the capture and sack of
    Rome by a wandering tribe of Gauls from the
    north, who descended the valley of the Tiber,
    took the Romans by surprise, and utterly
    routed them at the little river Allia, twelve
    miles from the city. These Gauls were formidable
    in battle and fairly frightened the
    Romans; but, like other Celtic peoples, they
    were incapable of settling down into a solid
    State, or of making good use of their victories.
    They vanished as quickly as they had come,
    and left nothing behind them but an indelible
    memory of the terror they had inspired, and
    many stories of the agony of that catastrophe.
    The most characteristic of these shows the
    veneration of the Romans for what was
    perhaps their greatest political institution,
    the Senate. The citizens had fled to the
    Capitol, where they contrived to hold out till
    relief came; but meanwhile the older Senators,
    men who were past the age of fighting,
    determined to meet their death, and devoted
    themselves, according to an old religious
    practice resorted to in extreme peril, to the
    infernal deities. Each then took his seat in
    state robes at the door of his house. There
    the Gauls found them and marvelled, taking
    <span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
    them for more than human. At last a Gaul
    ventured to stroke the beard of one of them
    named Papirius, who immediately struck him
    with his ivory wand: he was instantly slain,
    and of the rest not one survived. We need
    not ask whether this story is true or not, for
    it is impossible to test it: but it is truly
    Roman in feeling, and from a religious point
    of view it falls in line with others that were
    told of the sacrifice of the individual for the
    State.</p>
<p>This experience was a terrible discipline for
    the Romans, but no sooner had the Gauls
    departed than they began to turn it to practical
    account. They saw that they must
    secure the country to the north of them more
    effectually, and they did so by making large
    portions of it Roman territory, and by establishing
    two colonies there, <i>i.e.</i> garrisoned
    fortresses on military roads. Then they
    turned to deal with their own confederates,
    who perhaps had felt a secret satisfaction in
    the humiliation of a leader of whom they were
    jealous, and were now, especially the two
    great neighbouring cities of Tibur and Præneste
    (Tivoli and Palestrina), beginning to
    rise in open revolt. Knowing what happened
    <span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
    afterwards, we can say that these Latin cities
    were standing in the way of Italian progress:
    but to the ancient city-state independence was
    the very salt of life.</p>
<p>All public records and materials for history,
    except those engraved on stone, were destroyed
    in the capture and burning of Rome
    by the Gauls, so that up to this time Roman
    “history” is not really worthy of the name.
    But from this time onward certain official
    records were preserved, and we gradually pass
    into an age which may truly be called historical.
    In detail it will still be questionable,
    chiefly owing to the tendency of Roman
    leading families to glorify the deeds of their
    own ancestors at the expense of truth, and so
    to hand on false accounts to the age when
    history first came to be written down. But
    in the fourth and third centuries <span class="small">B.C.</span> it
    becomes fairly clear in outline. I said in the
    last chapter that the Romans were curiously
    destitute of the imaginative faculty. But no
    people is entirely without imagination, and it
    is most interesting to find the Romans using
    their moderate allowance in inventing the
    details of noble deeds and honourable services
    to the State. Provoking as it is to us, and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
    provoking even to the Roman historian Livy
    himself, who was well aware of it, this habit
    has its own value as a feature of old Roman
    life and character.</p>
<p>But I must return to the story of the
    advance of Rome in Italy. It seems clear
    that after the Gallic invasion the Latins
    became more and more discontented with
    Roman policy, which probably aimed at
    utilising all the resources of the league and at
    the same time getting complete control of its
    relations to other powers. We have the text
    in Greek, preserved by the historian Polybius,
    of a treaty with Carthage, then the greatest
    naval power in the Mediterranean, which well
    illustrates this: the date is 348 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Rome
    acts for Latium in negotiating this treaty;
    and Carthage undertook not to molest the
    Latin cities, <i>provided that they remained faithful
        to Rome</i>; nay, even to restore to the
    power of the leading city any revolting Latin
    community that might fall into their hands.
    This plainly shows that revolt was expected,
    and a few years later it became general. But
    in spite of the support of the Campanians in
    the rich volcanic plain farther south, and
    indeed of danger so great that it gave rise to
    <span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
    another story of the “devotio” of a Roman
    consul to the infernal deities on behalf of
    the State, the Latins were completely beaten
    at the battle of Mount Vesuvius, and the
    Romans were able so to alter the league as
    to deprive it of all real claim to be called a
    federation.</p>
<p>We saw that any citizen of a Latin city
    could buy and hold property, marry and have
    legitimate children, in any other Latin city,
    knowing that he was protected by the law
    in the enjoyment of these rights. But after
    the rebellion this was all changed. A citizen
    could enjoy these rights in his own city, or at
    Rome, but nowhere else, while a Roman could
    enjoy them everywhere. A citizen of Præneste,
    for example, could enjoy them at
    Præneste or Rome, but not in the neighbouring
    cities of Tibur or Tusculum: while a
    Roman could do business in all these cities,
    and be supported in all his dealings by the
    Roman law, which now began gradually to
    permeate the whole of Latium. Rome thus
    had a monopoly of business with the other
    cities, which were effectually isolated from
    each other. To us this seems a cruel and
    selfish policy, and so in itself it was. But we
    <span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
    must remember that Rome had been all but
    destroyed off the face of the earth, and that
    the Latins had done nothing, so far as we
    know, to help her. To resist another such
    attack as that of the Gauls, it was absolutely
    necessary for Rome to control the whole
    military resources of Latium, and this she
    could not do in a loose and equal federation.
    She was liable not only to assaults from the
    Gauls, but from Etruscans, and, as we shall
    see directly, from Samnites, and, if we find
    that in the struggle for existence she was at
    times unjust, we may remember that there
    has hardly been a successful nation of which
    the same might not be said. She saw that
    Latium must become Roman if either Rome
    or the Latins were to survive, and she devised
    the principle of isolation with this
    object.</p>
<p>From this time all Latins served in Roman
    armies nominally as allies, but in reality as
    subjects; and all Latins who became Roman
    citizens served in the Roman legions. When
    a military colony was founded, it might be
    either Roman or Latin; but a Latin colony
    meant not necessarily a collection of Latins;
    it might admit any one—Roman, Latin or
    <span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
    other, who threw in his lot with the new city
    and accepted the two rights of trade and
    marriage described above. Thus the term
    Latin came to mean not so much a man of a
    certain stock as a man with a certain legal
    position, and so it continued for many centuries,
    while the new power rising to prominence
    in the world came to be known not as
    Latin, but as Roman.</p>
<p>The last and decisive battle with the
    Latins took its name, as we saw, from Mount
    Vesuvius, and the reader who knows the map
    of Italy will ask how it came to be fought so
    far south of Latium, in the large and fertile
    plain of Campania, near the modern city of
    Naples. The answer is that a powerful State,
    such as Rome was now becoming, is liable to
    be appealed to by weaker communities when
    in trouble; and the Campanians, attacked by
    the hill-men from the central mountainous
    region of the Samnites, had appealed for help
    to Rome. This was given, but the Romans
    found it necessary to make peace with these
    Samnites, and left the Campanians in the
    lurch, and then the latter threw in their lot
    with the Latins, and the Latin war drifted
    south to Campania. At the end of that war
    <span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
    they were treated in much the same way as
    the Latins; and thus Rome now found herself
    presiding with irresistible force over a
    territory that included both the plains of
    western Italy and all its most valuable
    land, and over a confederacy in which all
    the advantages were on her side, and all
    the resources of the members under her
    control.</p>
<p>But to be mistress of these two plains was
    not as yet to be mistress of Italy. Those
    plains, and especially the southern and more
    valuable one, had to be defended from the
    mountaineers of the central highlands of the
    peninsula: a region which the reader should
    at this point of our story study carefully in
    his map. Towards the end of the Latin war
    these highlanders, Samnites, as the Romans
    called them, had ceased raiding the Campanian
    plain, for they in their turn had to
    defend southern Italy against an unexpected
    enemy. The strong and wealthy Greek merchant-city
    of Tarentum, just inside the “heel”
    of Italy, destined to play an important part in
    Italian history for the next century, had lately
    had its lands raided by the Samnites and their
    kin the Lucanians to the south of them, and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
    had called in Greeks from oversea to help
    them. Here we come into touch with Greek
    history, just at the time when Alexander the
    Great was the leading figure in the Greek
    world. A Spartan king came over to aid
    Tarentum, and lost his life in so doing; then
    Alexander of Epirus was induced to come,
    an uncle of the great conqueror: and after
    a period of success against the Samnites, he
    was assassinated. It is said that Rome came
    to an understanding with him, and it is likely
    enough; there must have been men in the
    great Council at Rome who were already
    accustomed to look far ahead, and keep
    themselves informed of what was going on far
    away in Italy and even beyond the Italian
    seas. Her long struggle for existence had
    taught her venerable statesmen the arts of
    diplomacy, and we are not surprised to learn
    that after the death of Alexander she began
    to form alliances in that far country between
    the Samnites and Tarentum, much of which
    was rich and fertile, in order that when the
    inevitable struggle with the hill-men should
    come, she might have them enclosed between
    two foes—herself and Latium on the north
    and west, and the Apulians and Greeks in
    <span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
    the south and east. It seemed as if her power
    and prestige must continually go forward, or
    collapse altogether; the same alternative
    that faced the English in India in the eighteenth
    century and later. In neither case did
    the advancing power fully realise what the
    future was to be.</p>
<p>The inevitable struggle with the Samnites
    came, and lasted many years. We need not
    pursue it in detail, and indeed the details
    are quite untrustworthy as they have come
    down to us; but one episode in it is told
    so explicitly and has become so famous,
    that it deserves a place in our sketch as
    showing that hard feeling of national self-interest,
    without a touch of chivalry, that
    is gradually emerging as the guide of Roman
    action in her progress towards universal
    dominion.</p>
<p>A strong Roman army, under the command
    of both consuls, was pushing to the south
    through the mountains, and fell into a trap
    in a defile called the Caudine Forks,<a class="fn" id="fr_3"
                                            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_3">[3]</a>
    a name
    never forgotten by the Romans. All attempts
    <span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
    to escape were vain, and they were forced to
    capitulate. The terms dictated by Pontius
    the Samnite general were these: the consuls
    were to bind themselves on behalf of the
    Senate to agree to evacuate Samnium and
    Campania and the fortresses (<i>coloniæ</i>) which
    had been planted there, and to make peace
    with the Samnites as with an equal power.
    The consuls bound themselves by a solemn
    rite, and the army was allowed to go home,
    after being sent under the yoke, <i>i.e.</i> under
    a kind of archway consisting of one spear
    resting on two upright ones: this was an old
    Italian custom of dealing with a conquered
    army, which may have originally had a
    religious signification. When the disgraced
    legions reached Rome, and the consuls summoned
    the Senate to ratify their bond with
    Pontius, the Fathers, as they were called,
    positively refused to do so. The consuls and
    all who had made themselves responsible for
    the terms were sent back to Pontius as his
    prisoners, <i>but not the army</i>. His indignation
    was great, for he knew that Samnium had lost
    her chance, and would never have it again.
    The consuls, of course, had no power to bind
    the Senate, and the Samnite terms were such
    <span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
    as the Senate could not accept as the result
    of a single disaster caused by a general’s
    blunder: that was not the way in which the
    Romans carried on war. But the disgraced
    army should have been sent back too, and the
    Senate and people knew it. The speech
    which the later Roman historian puts into
    the mouth of Pontius to express his indignation,
    shows that some feeling of shame at
    this dishonourable action had come down in
    the minds of many generations.</p>
<p>The last effort of this long struggle against
    Rome was a desperate attempt to combine
    the forces of Samnites, Etruscans and Gauls:
    the idea was to separate her armies and
    thus crush her in detail. Even this was a
    failure, and without going into the doubtful
    stories of the fighting, we may ask why
    it was so. Beyond all doubt the Roman
    power was for a time in very great peril;
    but in the end it prevailed, and this is a
    good moment for pausing to think about the
    advantages that Rome’s genius for organisation
    had secured for herself; advantages
    which no other Italian stock seemed able
    to acquire.</p>
<p>First, she had learnt how to use with profit
    <span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
    her geographical position; to north, south
    and east she could send armies to strike in
    different directions at the same time; and
    she must have devised some means (though
    we do not know the method) of keeping up
    communication between these armies. The
    stories seem to suggest that the commanders
    of this period belonged to a very few noble
    families whose members had spent their
    whole lives in fighting—not indeed merely
    in fighting battles, but in carrying on war:
    the Fabii and Papirii are particularly prominent.
    These veterans must have come to
    know the art of war thoroughly, as it could
    then be applied in Italy, and also the details
    of the country in which they had to
    fight.</p>
<p>Secondly, the efforts of these tough old
    heroes were admirably seconded by the home
    government, <i>i.e.</i> the Senate, because this
    assembly consisted of men of the like military
    experience, and the leaders among them
    were themselves generals, men who had been
    consuls and had led armies. Though at this
    very time, as we shall see, there was a strong
    tendency towards popular government, yet
    in the direction of war we find no sign that
    <span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
    the monopoly of the old families was questioned;
    and as their interests and their
    experience were all of the same type, they
    could act together with a unanimity which
    was probably unknown to their enemies.
    The fact that Rome always at this time, and
    indeed at all times, negotiated and kept in
    touch with the <i>aristocracies</i> in the Italian
    cities, shows how completely the noble families
    had gained control over the management
    of diplomacy as well as war.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Rome was now beginning to learn
    the art of securing the conquered country
    by means of military roads and fortresses
    (<i>coloniæ</i>): an art to which she held firmly
    throughout her history, and to which the
    geography even of Roman Britain bears
    ample testimony. My readers will do well to
    fix their attention for a moment on three of
    these colonies which were founded during this
    long war; they are by no means the only
    ones, but they serve well to show the extent
    of the Roman power in Italy at this time, as
    well as the means taken to secure it. The
    first is Narnia, far up the Tiber valley
    (founded 299 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) on a military road afterwards
    known as the Flaminian Way: this
    <span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
    was an outpost, with quick communication
    with Rome, against both Etruscans and
    Gauls. The second, Fregellæ, a city with a
    sad future, was some seventy miles to the
    south-east of Rome, on a road called the
    Latin Way, but beyond the limits of Latium
    proper, commanding, in fact, the passes between
    Latium and Campania; it was in a
    beautiful situation near the junction of two
    rivers, and became in time a most prosperous
    city. For the third colony we must look much
    further south on the map, at the south-eastern
    end of the mass of the Samnite highlands:
    this was Venusia, with 20,000 colonists,
    destined to separate the Samnites from the
    Greeks and other inhabitants of the heel and
    toe of Italy. It stood on the most famous of
    all the great roads, the Via Appia, which after
    leaving Rome ran nearer the coast than the
    Latin Way, but joined it in Campania, and
    then ran across the hilly country to Venusia,
    and eventually to Brundisium (Brindisi),
    which also became a colony fifty years later.</p>
<p>These three advantages, duly considered,
    will help the reader to understand to some
    extent how the prize of Italian presidency
    fell to Rome and not to another city: and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
    they will also explain why Rome emerged safe
    and stronger than ever from another peril
    that was now to threaten her existence.</p>
<p>The great colony of Venusia, as we saw, was
    meant to separate the Greeks of southern
    Italy from the highlanders of Samnium. Of
    the Greek cities by far the most powerful was
    Tarentum, then ruled by a selfish and ill-conditioned
    democracy, apt to be continually
    worrying its neighbours. That Rome should
    sooner or later come into collision with
    Tarentum was inevitable; but the Senate
    tried to avoid this, knowing that the Tarentines
    would appeal to some Greek power
    beyond sea to help them. Now just across
    the Adriatic, in Epirus, there was a king of
    Greek descent who was looking out for a
    chance of glory by imitating Alexander the
    Great; for Alexander’s marvellous career had
    stirred up a restless spirit of adventure in the
    free-lances of the generation that succeeded
    him. Pyrrhus seems to have fancied that he
    could act the part of a knight-errant in freeing
    the Greeks of the west from the barbarians—from
    the Romans that is, and the Carthaginians,
    who were at the moment in alliance.
    When the inevitable quarrel with Rome
    <span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
    came, and Tarentum invited him, he crossed
    the sea with a small but capable force, determined
    to put an end to this new power that
    was threatening to swallow up the Greek
    cities. But he had to learn, and through him
    the Greek world had to learn as a whole, that
    the new power was made of sterner stuff than
    any that had yet arisen in the Mediterranean
    basin.</p>
<p>Pyrrhus began with a victory, not far from
    Tarentum; it was won chiefly by some elephants
    which he had brought with him to
    frighten the Roman cavalry. This shook the
    loyalty of many Italian communities, but the
    Senate was unmoved. The ablest diplomatist
    in Pyrrhus’s service made no impression on
    that body of resolute men, trained by long
    experience to look on a single defeat as only a
    “regrettable incident” in a long war. “Rome
    never negotiates while foreign troops are on
    Italian soil;” so, according to the story, the
    aged Appius Claudius told the Greek envoy
    in the Senate-house. Then Pyrrhus tried a
    march on Rome; but he had to learn, like
    another invader after him, that the nearer
    he drew to the city the more difficult his
    task became. A second victory was far less
    <span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
    decisive and almost fruitless, and Pyrrhus
    most unwisely evacuated Italy. Tarentum
    had turned against him, unwilling to submit
    to his discipline, and now that wayward city
    fell a victim to the Roman power. The king
    crossed to Sicily to deliver the Sicilian Greeks
    from Carthage, and this he did brilliantly, but
    there, too, the fickle Greeks grew tired of him.
    Returning to Italy, he fought one more battle
    with the Romans, at Beneventum in Samnium,
    and lost it. Foiled everywhere, he left
    Italy, with Rome more firmly established
    than ever in the supremacy of the whole
    peninsula: for Tarentum, with its fine harbour,
    its almost impregnable citadel, and its
    fleet, fell soon afterwards into the hands of
    the Romans.</p>
<p>Almost the whole Italian peninsula was
    now Roman; or perhaps it is truer to say that
    Rome had become an Italian state. It was
    a wonderful work: perhaps the most wonderful
    that Rome ever achieved. The military
    part of it was the result mainly of <i>constantia</i>,
    steady perseverance and refusal to accept
    defeat; the political organisation was the
    result of good sense and good temper combined
    with an inflexible will, and a shrewd
    <span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
    perception of the real and permanent interests
    of Rome. In the third century <span class="small">B.C.</span>, at
    which we have now arrived, Italy may be
    described as a kind of federation, in which
    each city has its own alliance with the leading
    one, and no alliance with any other. Each
    has its own government and administers its
    own law, but places all its military resources
    at the disposal of the Roman government.
    The fighting power of the future was to be
    Italy under Roman leadership, and all questions
    of foreign policy were decided by Rome
    alone. There was no general council of the
    whole confederacy. The Roman Senate
    controlled an ever-increasing mass of detailed
    and varied business, having to deal with
    Latins, Italians of the old stocks, Etruscans,
    Greeks and Gauls. How the business was
    done we cannot tell: not a single contemporary
    record of it is left. One glimpse of that
    wonderful Senate at work would be worth all
    descriptions of the battles of that century.</p>
<p>Before the close of the third century <span class="small">B.C.</span>
    that Senate, instead of directing a further
    steady advance, had been forced to defend
    the State against an invader, in the most
    terrible life and death struggle ever experienced
    <span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
    by any people. But in the next chapter
    I must pause to try and explain wherein
    consisted the nerve-power, the mental and
    material fibre, of the people destined to rule
    the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
    <br><span class="h2line2">THE TRAINING OF THE ROMAN CHARACTER</span></h2>
<p>I have mentioned some outward circumstances
    which gave Rome an early training
    in war and diplomacy, and in particular her
    geographical position, exposing her to constant
    attack, and yet giving her good chance
    of striking back and advancing. But to
    accomplish all that was told of her in the
    last chapter, more than this was surely
    needed. There must have been a quality in
    this people, individually and as a whole,
    fitting them to withstand so much storm
    and stress, and to emerge from disaster
    with renewed strength to take in hand the
    work of conquest and government. We need
    not, indeed, assume that the people of this
    one city were naturally of stronger character
    than others, than their kinsfolk of the Latin
    cities or other Italians of the same great race.
    All these immigrating stocks, which spread
    themselves, long before history begins, over a
    <span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
    primitive population of which we know little
    or nothing, were probably much the same in
    physical and mental build; a fact which will
    help us to understand how they all came
    eventually to be able to unite together as the
    centre of a great empire. But the quality
    or character, which I am to try and explain
    in this chapter, was more strongly stamped
    upon the citizens of Rome than on those of
    other cities, owing to the more continual call
    for them in her case; for all our qualities and
    habits can be made more sure and lasting by
    constant exercise.</p>
<p>Discipline and duty are the two words
    which best explain, if they do not exactly
    express, the quality here meant; the habit of
    obedience to authority, which is the necessary
    condition of the power of governing, and that
    sense of duty which lies at the root of the
    habit and the power. This aptitude for
    discipline and this sense of duty can be
    traced both in the private and the public
    life of early Rome, in the life of the family
    and in the life of the State. Let us be clear
    at once that the individual as such was not
    as yet an important item of society; society
    was based on a system of groups, and the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
    individual played no part in it in these early
    times except as the member of a group,
    either a group of kin (<i>gens</i>), or a local and
    administrative group (<i>pagus</i>, <i>curia</i>). But the
    only group with which we are concerned in
    this little book, the smallest of all, was the
    <i>familia</i>, another of those immortal words
    which we have inherited from the Latin
    language. This shall be explained first, in
    order to find the discipline and duty of that
    family life: then we will take the State, and
    follow out the same habits reproducing themselves
    in a more complicated social and political
    union.</p>
<p>This word <i>familia</i> did not mean exactly
    what we mean by family; household would
    perhaps come nearer to it, if we understand
    by household a group of individuals supporting
    itself on the land. It meant not only
    father, mother, and children, but also their
    dependents, whether bond or free. These, if
    bond, were slaves (<i>servi</i>), prisoners of war
    and the children of such prisoners, or persons
    who had forfeited their liberty by debt:
    if free, they were clients, who for some reason
    had become attached to the <i>familia</i> in an
    inferior position, and looked to it for subsistence
    <span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
    and protection. And our picture is
    not complete unless we take into account
    also the divine members of the group, dwelling
    in the house or on the land, to whom the
    human members looked for protection and
    prosperity in all the walks of life. Chief
    among these were the spirit of the hearth-fire,
    Vesta; Penates, the spirits of the store-closet
    and its contents: the Lar, the guardian spirit
    of the cultivated land, or, as some think, of a
    departed ancestor; and the Genius of the
    head of the family, which enabled him to
    beget children and so continue the collective
    life of the group. Though these spirits—they
    are hardly yet deities—naturally seem
    to us mere fancies of the primitive Roman
    mind, they were to that mind itself as real
    and active as any human member of the
    group, and we must try to think of them as
    such, for they played a very important part
    in the development of the quality we wish
    to realise.</p>
<p>Now this group, or rather the human part
    of it, lived under a very simple and effective
    form of government. It was under the absolute
    control of a head, the father and husband;
    or, if more than one family lived together,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
    the oldest living father and husband. Over
    wife and children he had a father’s power
    (<i>patria potestas</i>), and they were said to be in
    his <i>hand</i>; over the slaves he had a master’s
    power (<i>dominium</i>): to his clients he was
    <i>patronus</i>, or quasi-father. His power over
    wife and children was absolute, but it was
    kept from being arbitrary by a wholesome
    custom, of immense importance in all its
    results throughout Roman history, of seeking
    the advice of a council of relations before
    taking any extreme step in the way of punishment
    for serious offences. This was an
    obligation, a duty, on his part, enforced by
    no law, but by what may be well called an
    even more powerful sovereign than law—the
    custom of the ancestors (<i>mos majorum</i>). His
    power over his client, or his freed slave if he
    had any such, was restrained by customs of
    mutual obligation, which eventually found
    their way into law. His power over his
    slaves was, however, not only absolute but
    arbitrary, and so continued down to the
    latest period of Roman history; yet the
    slave, we must not forget, was really a member
    of the <i>familia</i>, and as such was probably
    treated as a human being, necessary to the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
    life of the group, and even partaking to
    some extent in its religious worship.</p>
<p>Let us see how this system of government
    would work out in the practical life of a <i>familia</i>
    settled on the land, as all such groups
    were during at least a great part of the period
    we have been tracing: for the city itself was
    mainly used as a fortress, into which the farming
    families would come in time of peril, and
    in which they would in course of time possess
    a town dwelling as well as a farm, like the
    leading families of our English shires in the
    Middle Ages. The paterfamilias directed all
    the operations of the farm, no one disputing
    his authority: and he decided all quarrels
    among his subjects and punished all offences.
    The necessary work of the house, the cooking,
    and the spinning of wool for the garments
    of the members (which were then entirely
    woollen), he left to his wife and daughters:
    and thus the wife came to exercise a kind of
    authority of her own, which raised her far
    above the position of a “squaw,” and gave
    her in course of time a great influence, though
    an indirect one, in social life. And not only
    had all the members their work to do, under
    this strict control, in keeping themselves alive
    <span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
    and clothed, but they all had their duties to
    the divine members, on whom they believed
    themselves dependent for their health and
    wealth. There were simple acts of worship
    every day and at every meal, in which the
    children joined; we may almost think of the
    Head as a priest and of the children as his
    acolytes. And at certain days, fixed in
    ancient times by a council of Heads, and later
    in the city by a calendar, the families of a
    district (<i>pagus</i>) would join together in religious
    festivities, after harvest, for example, or
    after the autumn sowing, to honour and
    propitiate the spirit of the harvested grain
    or of the sown seed. These were often accompanied
    by games and races, and so the life
    was saved from becoming too sombre and
    monotonous. But though discipline was not
    allowed to destroy freedom and enjoyment,
    the life was on the whole a routine of command
    and obedience, of discipline and duty.</p>
<p>What of the education which should perpetuate
    these habits? Unluckily we have
    no contemporary record of it for these early
    times, and must guess at it chiefly from what
    we know of the bringing up of his son by the
    elder Cato, a strenuous believer in the old
    <span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
    methods, in the second century <span class="small">B.C.</span> As we
    might expect, it seems to have been an education
    in the active practical life of the farm,
    and in reverence, obedience, and modesty of
    demeanour. Cato taught his boy not only to
    work, to ride, to box, and to swim, but to shun
    all indecency; and was himself “as careful
    not to utter an indecent word before his son,
    as he would have been in the presence of the
    Vestal virgins.” He wrote histories for his
    son in large letters, so that he might learn
    something of the illustrious deeds of the
    ancient Romans, and of their customs. In
    his time an education of the mind was beginning
    to come into vogue, as well as one of
    the will; but in the period we have been
    surveying this must have been of the most
    meagre kind. Yet it is possible that the idea
    of active duty to the State and its deities, as
    well as to the family and its presiding spirits,
    was all the more vividly kept up in the absence
    of intellectual interests. As life in the
    city became more usual, the boys of good
    families had more opportunity of learning
    what was meant by duty to the State; they
    accompanied their fathers to hear funeral
    orations on eminent citizens, and were even
    <span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
    admitted to meetings of the Senate. In this
    way they must have developed a shrewdness
    and practical sagacity invaluable to them in
    after life.</p>
<p>There is a story of a Roman boy, preserved
    by Cato, which so well illustrates this and
    other features of that early Roman life, that
    I shall insert it here, whether or no it be
    strictly true. A boy who had been with his
    father to the Senate was asked by an inquisitive
    mother what the Fathers of the Senate
    had been discussing. The boy answered
    that he was strictly forbidden to tell, which
    only excited his mother’s curiosity the more,
    and made her press him hard. At last he
    invented what Cato calls a shrewd and witty
    falsehood: he said that the Senate had been
    discussing whether it were better for the
    State that one man should have two wives, or
    one wife two husbands. Much alarmed, she
    went and told other matrons, and next day
    they crowded weeping to the Senate House, to
    petition that one wife might have two husbands
    rather than one husband two wives.
    The astonishment of the senators was dispelled
    by the boy, who stood out in the midst
    and told his tale; and from that time no boy
    <span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
    was allowed to be present at debate save
    this one, who was thus rewarded for his
    honesty and shrewdness.</p>
<p>This good old Roman story may aptly
    bring us to the second part of my subject in
    this chapter, the training of the citizen in the
    service of the State. But let us pause here
    for a moment to consider what was the Roman
    idea of the State and its function.</p>
<p>In Italy, as in Greece, the State took the
    form of a city, with more or less of territory
    on which to subsist; in the heart of the city
    was the life of the State. And it is true of
    Italy as of Greece that the process of rising
    to the city from the life of farm or village was
    one of immense importance for humanity,
    enabling man to advance from the idea of a
    bare material subsistence to that of moral and
    intellectual progress. This is the advance
    to what Aristotle called “good life” as distinguished
    from life simply. He meant that
    in the lower stage man has not time or stimulus
    to develop art, literature, law, philosophy:
    all his strength is spent in struggle and endeavour—struggle
    partly with Nature, partly
    with human enemies whom he is ill able to
    resist. The city-state supplied him not only
    <span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
    with opportunity for a higher life, but with
    nutriment to maintain it.</p>
<p>But the Italians never drew from this new
    form of social life the same amount, the same
    quality of nutriment, as did the Greeks.
    Rome did indeed draw enough to fertilise the
    germs of much that was most valuable in her
    own character, and to educate herself for the
    practical work she was to do in the world.
    But the last chapter will have shown that,
    unlike most Greek city-states, she was forced
    by circumstances to continue for centuries a
    life of struggle and endeavour. She had constant
    difficulty in keeping herself alive and
    free, and as we shall see, she was hardly ever
    without internal as well as external perils.
    In Greece many States found leisure to rest
    and enjoy the exercise of their higher
    instincts—enjoyment which led to the
    production of works of art and literature: leisure,
    too, to reflect and inquire about Nature in
    man and outside him, and so to develop
    philosophy and science for the eternal benefit
    of mankind. But all the strength of Rome
    was used in the struggle for existence, which
    gradually led her on to conquest and dominion.
    As we left her at the end of the last
    <span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
    chapter, the leading city of Italy, she might
    indeed have passed from struggle to leisure,
    and so to thought and inquiry, turning to
    account the gifts of the various peoples of
    Italy, Etruscans, Gauls, Greeks, as well as
    her own kin. But the long and terrible
    struggle with Carthage, to be told in the next
    chapter, effectually destroyed this chance.
    Her strength was spent when it was over, and
    when her chance came to sit down (so to
    speak), and think, she could not do it. Still,
    her long training in practical endeavour had
    its due result; and the ideas of duty and
    discipline, of law and order, which had carried
    her through so many perils, never wholly
    vanished from the Roman mind. Let us
    turn to trace the progress of those ideas in
    the life of the city-state of Rome.</p>
<p>When we first begin to see clearly into the
    working of the Roman State, what chiefly
    strikes us is the unlimited power of the magistrate
    in all the departments of government.
    Just as the head of the family had an absolute
    power over its members, so had the king (<i>rex</i>)
    an unlimited power over the citizens. In the
    family the word for this power was <i>potestas</i>,
    but in the State it was called <i>imperium</i>—one
    <span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
    of the greatest words ever coined, surviving
    to the present day in many familiar forms.
    For the Roman it expressed more strikingly
    than any other the idea of discipline in the
    State: it stamped on his mind the inherited
    conviction that lawful authority must be
    implicitly obeyed. Not unlawful authority,
    ill gotten by fraud or violence; for such power
    the word <i>imperium</i> could never be used: but
    authority entrusted to an individual by the
    human members of the State, and sanctioned
    by the consent of its divine members. For
    the <i>imperium</i> must be conferred upon its
    holder by an act of the people, and the gods
    must give their consent by favourable omens;
    both processes, the passing of the law, and
    the obtaining of the <i>auspicia</i>, must be gone
    through according to certain traditional
    methods, and the slightest flaw in these
    would make the choice of the magistrate
    invalid. But once legally in his hands, the
    <i>imperium</i> was irresistible; its outward symbols,
    the rods and axes of the lictors, accompanied
    its holder wherever he went, to remind
    the Roman that the first duty of a citizen
    was obedience to constituted authority.</p>
<p>This word <i>imperium</i> stood for three different
    <span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
    kinds of power. First, the king was
    supreme in matters of religion, for he was
    responsible for the good relations between the
    human and divine inhabitants of the city,
    for “the peace of the gods” as it was called.
    If this peace, or covenant, were not kept up,
    it was believed that the State could not
    prosper—the very life of the State depended
    on it.</p>
<p>But now let us note a point of the utmost
    importance in the development of Roman
    public life. The king could not perform
    this duty entirely by himself; no single man
    could have the necessary knowledge of all
    the details of ancient religious custom. So
    he was assisted by a small board of skilled
    experts called <i>pontifices</i>, perhaps also by
    another board of <i>augurs</i>, skilled in the methods
    of discovering the divine will by omens.
    Thus the <i>imperium</i> in religious matters,
    though still legally unlimited, was saved
    from becoming arbitrary and violating
    ancestral custom: the king is entrusted with
    power which he uses in accordance with the
    advice of sages.</p>
<p>Secondly, <i>imperium</i> stood for the supreme
    judicial power, for the maintenance of peace
    <span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
    between individual citizens. The king had
    an unlimited power not only in deciding disputes
    but in inflicting punishments, even that
    of death. But here again, though his power
    was absolute, it was not arbitrary. Custom
    governed the State even more than he did,
    and his work was to see that custom was
    obeyed. In order to make sure that this duty
    was rightly performed, he was provided with
    a council of elderly men (<i>senatores</i>), fathers
    of families, whose advice custom compelled
    him to ask, though it did not compel him to
    take it. Here, then, the exercise of discipline
    was combined with a sense of duty and obligation,
    as in the life of the family; the Senate
    of the State was the same in principle as the
    council of relations in the family.</p>
<p>Thirdly, <i>imperium</i> stood for the absolute
    power of the commander in war: and here,
    as we might expect, custom seems hardly to
    have interfered with it. A Roman king in
    war was outside the custom of his own State,
    beyond the reach of the protection of his own
    deities, and under the influence of unknown
    ones. Both before starting on a campaign,
    and before entering the city on its return, the
    army had to undergo certain religious rites,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
    which show how nervous even Romans were
    about leaving their own land and gods.
    Custom could not rule here, and the power
    of the general in the field remained throughout
    Roman history not only absolute but arbitrary.
    Doubtless he could, and often did, not
    only ask advice but take it, but he was never
    even morally obliged to do so: in this one
    department of State activity the wise judgment
    of the Romans left the <i>imperium</i>
    practically unhampered.</p>
<p>Such, then, was the <i>imperium</i> in the hands
    of the chief magistrate, the foundation-stone
    of the Roman government in all periods.
    But what of the people who obeyed it? Of
    the people we unluckily know hardly anything
    until nearly the end of the monarchical
    period. We do, indeed, know that, as in
    many Greek city-states, there was a privileged
    and an unprivileged class, and of these two
    classes a word shall be said directly. What
    needs here to be made clear is how this population
    was placed as regards duty and discipline,
    and our first real knowledge of this
    dates traditionally from the reign of the last
    king but one. Here we find the whole free
    population, privileged and unprivileged, serving
    <span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
    in the army as a civic duty, and paying
    such taxes as were necessary mainly for
    military purposes. They served without pay,
    and the infantry—that is, by far the greater
    part, provided their own arms and equipment;
    the cavalry were provided with horses by the
    State, for horses were expensive. Those who
    had most property were considered as having
    the largest stake in the State, and therefore
    as bound to bear the heaviest burden. This
    may be seen in the order of the army for
    battle, for those who could afford the best
    equipment fought in front, the poorest and
    worst armed in the rear. This was the wholesome
    principle that governed the Roman
    army during the period of advance and conquest
    in Italy. It was an army of citizens
    (<i>populus</i>), all of whom served as a matter of
    duty, and paid taxes as a matter of duty according
    to their means, leaving all command
    to the holder of <i>imperium</i>, and the officers
    whom he appointed to carry out his orders.</p>
<p>Thus when the last king was expelled, and
    the kingship came to an end, the people were
    thoroughly well trained in the ideas of duty
    and discipline, and the practical results of
    such a training were obedience as a habit,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
    respect for authority and knowledge, steadiness
    and coolness in danger. This people did
    not give way to excitement, either in civil or
    military crises. They not only obeyed their
    rulers, but trusted them. They were not
    much given to talking, but contented themselves
    with action: and as talk is a more effective
    stimulus to quarrelling than action, they
    did not as yet quarrel. Though Rome was
    destined to pass through many political as
    well as military dangers in the generations
    to come, it was nearly four centuries before
    blood was shed in civil strife in her streets.</p>
<p>I must close this chapter with a very brief
    sketch of the political history of the period
    of advance in Italy, in order to show how
    their training in duty and discipline kept the
    people steady and sound at home.</p>
<p>After the expulsion of the last king the
    Roman State became a <i>respublica</i>—that is,
    literally translated, a public thing—or as we
    may perhaps call it, a free State. This is
    another of the immortal words bequeathed to
    modern European language by Latin speech,
    and its meaning is still the same for us as it
    was for the Romans. When Cicero, almost at
    the end of the life of the Roman free State,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
    wrote to a friend, “We have completely lost
    the <i>respublica</i>,” he meant that it had passed
    from public management into the hands of
    private and irresponsible individuals. What
    were the essential marks of this “public
    thing,” or free State? As we might expect,
    they are to be found in the treatment of the
    <i>imperium</i>, the governmental centre of gravity,
    by the founders of the <i>respublica</i>.</p>
<p>1. To abolish the <i>imperium</i> was out of the
    question; no Roman ever dreamed of such
    a thing, for it would be like digging up the
    foundations of a building already in part
    constructed. But the <i>imperium</i> was no
    longer to be held for life, nor to be held by a
    single person. It was now to be entrusted to
    two magistrates instead of one, and for a year
    only; at the end of the year the holders,
    henceforward to be called Consuls or Prætors,
    were to lay down their insignia and resign
    their power, becoming simply private citizens
    again. Meanwhile new consuls had been
    elected; and the voice of the whole people
    was to be heard in the election, for it was to
    be effected by the army of citizens, arranged
    according to property as in military service.
    Every Roman who was to obey the <i>imperium</i>
    <span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
    was to have a voice in the election of its
    holders, but those who had most stake
    in the State, and served in the front ranks
    in war, were to have a preponderating
    voice.</p>
<p>2. The dread <i>imperium</i> was now not only
    limited in the period of its tenure, but the
    possibility of an arbitrary use of it was averted
    in two ways. First, the two consuls had a
    veto on each other’s action, and both at home
    and in the field they took it in turn to exercise
    the <i>imperium</i>. Secondly, they could not
    put a citizen to death in the city unless the
    people in their assembly sanctioned it; in
    the field the Romans wisely left the <i>imperium</i>
    unlimited, feeling, as we still feel, that military
    discipline needs a more forceful sanction
    than civil. And besides these two restrictions,
    the council of elders, the Senate, was
    retained to act as a general advising body
    for the consuls, who, however, themselves had
    the power of filling up vacancies in it from
    time to time. We do not know exactly what
    its composition was at this time; but it is
    certain that all who had held the <i>imperium</i>
    had seats in it, as men whose service and experience
    best entitled them to advise and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
    criticise their successors. This principle, that
    ex-magistrates should be members of the
    Senate, was adhered to at all times, and
    eventually made this great council into the
    most effective assembly of men of capacity
    and experience in practical life that the world
    has ever seen.</p>
<p>Before we leave the <i>imperium</i>, for the
    present, one interesting fact must be noted.
    The Romans were not afraid to withdraw
    for a time these restrictions on the magistrate’s
    power, and to revert to absolute government,
    if they thought it necessary for the
    safety of the State. In moments of great
    peril, civil or military, the consul, on the
    advice of the Senate, would appoint a single
    individual to hold office for a fixed time with
    unlimited <i>imperium</i>; and in this case the
    assembly was not called on even to ratify
    the choice, so great was the trust reposed in
    the Fathers of the State. They did not call
    this single magistrate by the hated name of
    Rex, but used another word well known in
    Latium, Dictator. The institution was of
    the utmost value to a people constantly in
    a state of struggle and endeavour, and
    shows well the practical sagacity which a
    <span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
    long training in duty and discipline had
    already developed.</p>
<p>But this practical sagacity was to be put to
    many a hard test in the period we sketched in
    the last chapter. No sooner was the <i>respublica</i>
    established, than a great question pressed
    for solution, that of the mutual relations of
    the privileged and unprivileged classes. What
    was really the origin of this distinction of
    class we do not yet know, and perhaps never
    shall. Here the fact must suffice, that the
    privileged, the patricians as they were called,
    the representatives of families belonging to
    the old clans (<i>gentes</i>) were alone deemed
    capable of preserving the peace between
    citizens and gods, or between the citizens
    themselves, and therefore they alone could
    hold the <i>imperium</i> and take the auspices.
    Both classes served in the army and voted
    at elections, but without the chance of holding
    the <i>imperium</i> the plebeians were helpless.
    Yet it is quite certain that they had grievances
    of their own, and real ones. We must
    think of them as in the main small holders of
    land, with little or no capital, and constantly
    obliged to borrow either in the form of money
    or stock. They became debtors to the rich,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
    who would usually be the patricians, and the
    old customary law of debt was hard and even
    savage.</p>
<p>The result of this was, according to the
    traditional story, that once at least, if not
    twice, they actually <i>struck</i>; they left their
    work and went off in a body, threatening
    to found a new city some miles farther up
    the Tiber. They knew well that they were
    indispensable to the State as soldiers, and
    the patricians knew it too. Fortunately, the
    plebeians also knew that the State, with all
    its traditions of religion and government, of
    duty and discipline, was indispensable to
    themselves. They knew nothing of the forms
    and formulæ which were deemed necessary
    for the maintenance of peace with gods and
    men. They could not carry away with them
    the gods of the city, under whose protection
    they and their forefathers had lived. They
    would simply be adrift, without oars or
    rudder, and such a position was absolutely
    unthinkable. So they returned to the city—so
    the story runs—and the result was a compromise,
    the first of a long series of compromises
    which finally made Rome into a
    compact and united commonwealth, and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
    enabled her to tide over three centuries of
    continual struggle and endeavour. The story
    of these compromises is too long and complicated
    to be told in this book, but the successive
    stages can briefly be pointed out.</p>
<p>Soon after the strike, or secession, the
    plebeians were authorised to elect magistrates,
    or more strictly officers, of their own,
    to protect them from any arbitrary use of the
    <i>imperium</i>; these were called Tribunes, because
    the assembly that chose them was
    arranged according to tribes, local divisions
    in which both patricians and plebeians were
    registered for taxpaying purposes. The
    good-will of the patricians in making this concession
    is seen in the fact that the tribunes
    of the plebs (as they were henceforward
    called), were placed under the protection of
    the gods (<i>sacrosancti</i>), so that any one violating
    them was made liable to divine anger.
    As the plebeians grew more numerous and
    indispensable, their assembly and officers
    became steadily more powerful, and eventually
    won the right to pass laws binding the
    whole State.</p>
<p>Again, it was not long before their ignorance
    of the customary law and its methods
    <span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
    of procedure found a remedy. A code of law
    was drawn up in twelve tables, containing
    partly old customs now for the first time
    written down, partly new rules, some of them
    perhaps imported from Athens. Of this code
    we still possess many fragments, which show
    plainly that it was meant for all citizens,
    whatever their social standing. “The idea of
    legislating for a class ... is strikingly absent.
    The code is thoroughly Roman in its
    caution and good sense, its respect for the
    past, which it disregards only when old customs
    violate the rules of common sense, and
    its judicious disregard of symmetry.”<a class="fn" id="fr_4"

    the historian Tacitus said of it long afterwards,
    it was “the consummation of equal
    right.” And it was the source of the whole
    mighty river of Roman law, ever increasing
    in volume, which still serves to irrigate the
    field of modern European civilisation.</p>
<p>There was to be a long and bitter contest
    before the plebeians forced their way into the
    central patrician stronghold of the <i>imperium</i>,
    but even this was accomplished without civil
    war or bloodshed. We hear of a series of
    evasive manœuvres by the patricians, who
    <span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
    naturally believed that all would go wrong if
    the duty of keeping “the peace of the gods”
    were committed to men whom the gods could
    not be supposed to take count of. But these
    patrician consuls and senators were responsible
    for the State’s existence, and it could not
    exist without the plebeians; the two classes
    were authorised by law to intermarry, which
    (strange to say) had been unlawful hitherto,
    and then the old class-feeling and prejudice,
    far exceeding in force any such feeling known
    to us now, gradually subsided. By the middle
    of the fourth century <span class="small">B.C.</span>, not only could a
    plebeian be consul, but one of the two consuls
    <i>must</i> be a plebeian. And before that century
    was over the old patrician nobility was beginning
    to disappear, giving way to a new one
    based on the leading idea of <i>good service done
        for the State</i>. If a man had held the consulship,
    no matter whether he were patrician or
    plebeian, he became <i>nobilis</i>—<i>i.e.</i> distinguished—and
    so, too, did his family. The great
    Roman aristocracy of later times consisted
    of the descendants of men who had thus
    become distinguished.</p>
<p>I will conclude this chapter with a few
    words about one remarkable institution which
    <span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
    well illustrates the Roman instinct for duty
    and discipline. It was in this period, 443 <span class="small">B.C.</span>,
    according to the traditional date, that a new
    magistracy was established, intended at first
    merely to relieve the consuls of difficult duties
    for which in that warlike age they had no
    sufficient leisure, but destined eventually to
    become even a higher object of ambition than
    the consulship itself. The Roman love of
    order made it necessary to be sure that every
    citizen was justly and legally a citizen, that
    he fulfilled his duties in the army, and paid
    his taxes according to a right estimate of his
    property. Every four or five years an inquiry
    had to be made with this object in view,
    and two censors, holding office for a year and
    a half, were now elected to undertake it.
    These censors, though they had no <i>imperium</i>,
    were irresponsible; their decisions were final,
    and they could not be called to account for
    any official act. They were almost always—in
    later times invariably—reverend seniors
    who had held the consulship, men in whose
    justice and wisdom the people could put
    implicit confidence. And such confidence was
    needed; for their power of examination easily
    became extended from details of registration
    <span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
    to the personal conduct of the citizen in
    almost every relation of life. All heads of
    families might be questioned about their performance
    of family duties, and any shameful
    cruelty to a slave, or injustice to a client, or
    neglect of children, might be punished by
    removal from the list of tribesmen; and this
    meant loss of civil rights, and <i>infamia</i> (civic
    disgrace), a terrible word, greatly dreaded by
    the Roman. Neglect of land or other property,
    useless luxury, bad faith in contracts or
    legal guardianship—all came in course of time
    to be taken count of by the censors. A
    senator might have his name struck off the
    list of the Senate, and a cavalry soldier might
    be removed from the roll, if the horse provided
    him by the State were ill cared for, or if
    in any other way he were deemed unworthy
    of his position.</p>
<p>It may be hard for us to understand how
    such a power of inquisition can have been
    submitted to in a free State. But apart from
    the age and standing of the holders of this
    office, and the Roman habit of obedience to
    constituted authority, there are two facts
    that will help us to understand it. One is
    simple: the censors were <i>collegæ</i> like the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
    consuls; each had a veto on the action of the
    other, and if that veto were not used, if they
    were unanimous in condemning a citizen, the
    authority of their decision was naturally
    irresistible. The other fact is harder for a
    modern to understand. There was a religious
    element in the work of the censors; the final
    act of a censorship was the religious “purification”
    (<i>lustratio</i>) of the whole citizen body,
    with sacrifice and prayer, in the field of Mars
    outside the walls of the city. What exactly
    a Roman of that day believed, or rather felt,
    to be the result of this rite, we can only guess;
    but we can be sure that he was convinced
    that the life of the State would be imperilled
    without it, and that this conviction was strong
    enough to compel him to submit to the whole
    process of which it was the consummation.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
    <br><span class="h2line2">THE STRUGGLE WITH CARTHAGE AND HANNIBAL</span></h2>
<p>In these days sober students of history
    wisely leave the oft-told stories of war and
    battle, and busy themselves rather with
    questions of social life, public and private
    economy, and the history of religion, morals
    and scientific inquiry. But there are a few
    wars, great struggles of nation against nation,
    which will always have an absorbing interest:
    partly because of their dramatic character,
    partly because of their far-reaching consequences;
    and the long fight between Rome
    and Carthage is assuredly one of these. On
    the Carthaginian side it produced two of the
    most extraordinary men, father and son, of
    whom history has anywhere to tell; and on
    the Roman side it gives us a vivid picture of
    the most marvellous endurance during long
    years of extreme peril that we can find in the
    annals of any people. And probably no war
    <span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
    was ever so pregnant of results for good and
    ill alike. It welded the whole of Italy south
    of the Alps into a united country under the
    rule of Rome, and launched the Romans on
    a new career of conquest beyond the sea;
    it laid the foundations of the Roman Empire
    as we now think of that great system. Yet
    it left Italy in a state of economic distress
    from which it is hardly untrue to say that
    she has never fully recovered, and it changed
    the character of the Roman people, rich and
    poor alike, for the worse rather than the
    better.</p>
<p>In order to see clearly how it came about,
    we must once more look at the map of Italy;
    a map of modern Italy will do well enough.
    Let the reader remember that as yet Rome
    had control only over the central and southern
    parts of the whole of what is now the kingdom
    of Italy, and that two other parts of
    that kingdom, which every Italian now regards
    as essential to its unity, were in other
    hands. These were: first, the great alluvial
    plain of the river Po (Padus); secondly, the
    island of Sicily: strategically speaking, these
    lie on the two flanks of the Roman dominion,
    to north and south respectively. Any power
    <span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
    holding central Italy, to be safe from invasion,
    must be in possession of these two positions,
    as a long series of wars has clearly shown,
    beginning with the two now to be sketched.
    The magnificent plain of the Po, stretching
    from the great Alpine barrier to the Apennines
    which look down on the Gulf of Genoa, the
    richest land in all Italy, was then in the hands
    of warlike Gallic tribes, who had settled
    there before the time when they struck
    southward and captured Rome itself; these
    might again become a serious danger, as
    indeed they proved to be in this very war.
    The island of Sicily was, and had long been,
    a bone of contention between the Greek
    settlers who had long ago built cities on the
    most favourable points of its coast, and the
    traders of the Phœnician city of Carthage
    just opposite to it on the coast of Africa.
    Sicily was rich in harbours, and like the plain
    of the Po, also rich in corn, olive, and vine;
    and the Greeks had held on to it so persistently
    that with the recent help of Pyrrhus
    they had for a moment been in almost complete
    possession of the island. But they
    foolishly deserted Pyrrhus at the critical
    moment, and now again the Carthaginians
    <span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
    had recovered it, all but the kingdom of
    Hiero of Syracuse, stretching along the
    eastern coast under Mount Etna. Carthaginian
    fleets cruised round the island, and
    were often seen off the coasts of Italy as well.
    For Carthage was the mistress of the seas
    in all the western part of the Mediterranean
    basin.</p>
<p>Carthage was a daughter of the Canaanite
    city of Tyre, belonging to that seafaring
    people known in history as Phœnicians, whom
    the Israelites had pushed down to the coast
    of Palestine without subduing them. The
    genius of the Phœnicians was for trade, and
    the splendid position of Carthage, near the
    modern Tunis, with a rich corn-growing
    country in the rear, had helped her merchant
    princes to establish by degrees what may
    loosely be called an empire of trading settlements
    extending not only along the African
    coast, but over that of Sardinia and southern
    and eastern Spain, and including Sicily, as
    we have seen. To maintain this empire she
    had to keep up great fleets, and huge docks
    in her own port; but as her Phœnician population
    was largely occupied with trade, she
    had to rely for her crews and also for her land
    <span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
    forces largely on the native Africans whom
    she had subdued, or on mercenaries hired
    from other races with whom she came in
    contact. Though this was a weak point in
    her armour, she was far the greatest power
    in the western seas, and any other people
    ambitious of power in that region would have
    to reckon with her. So far she had been on
    friendly terms with Rome, and we still have
    the text of three treaties between the two
    states; but the latest of these shows signs of
    mutual distrust, and Rome had now risen
    so high that a collision was all but inevitable.
    A people ruling in Italy cannot afford
    to have a rival in Sicily and also in undisputed
    command of the sea.</p>
<p>The collision came in the year 264 <span class="small">B.C.</span>,
    and it was the immediate result of an act of
    bad judgment and also of bad faith on the
    part of the Romans. There would be no
    need to mention this here if it did not illustrate
    a trait in the Roman character which
    is becoming more marked as Rome is drawn
    more and more into diplomatic relations with
    other states. The habit of order and discipline
    at home did not bring with it a sense of
    justice and honour in dealing with foreigners.
    <span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
    The Roman practical view of life, which did
    not include education of the mind and feeling,
    was not favourable to the growth of generous
    conduct except towards a fellow-citizen.
    The Latin word <i>virtus</i>, which expresses the
    practical duties of a citizen, does not suggest
    honourable dealing outside the civic boundary.
    Some mental imagination was needed
    for higher aims to make themselves felt in
    public life; “slimness,” as the Boers of the
    Transvaal used to call it, is too often characteristic
    of Roman diplomacy; and hardness,
    not always stopping short of cruelty, is
    henceforward constantly to be found in their
    conduct towards a beaten foe.</p>
<p>A rascally band of mercenaries, Italians
    by birth, who had been in the Syracusan
    service, had seized on the old Greek city of
    Messana—the same Messina which quite
    recently met with so terrible a fate in the
    great earthquake. The city lay on the
    Sicilian side of the strait which still bears
    its name, and looked at from an Italian point
    of view, might be called the key to Sicily.
    Exactly opposite to it was Rhegium (Reggio),
    another Greek city which had been treated
    in the same way by another band of brigands;
    <span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
    but these had been at once cleared out by
    orders from Rome. In the case of Messana
    the task naturally developed on Hiero, the
    king of Syracuse, a young man of ability
    who had lately made a treaty with Rome;
    but when he made the attempt, the brigands
    appealed for help both to Rome and to
    Carthage. The plain duty of the Senate
    was to support their ally Hiero, or to leave
    the applicants to their fate. But the Carthaginians
    might then establish themselves at
    Messana, and that must have seemed to a
    Roman a thing not to be permitted. The
    Senate hesitated for once, and finally referred
    the matter to the people, who voted to support
    the mercenaries against an ally of the
    Roman State. This act of bad faith and
    bad policy cost the Romans a valuable ally,
    and a war with Carthage that lasted without
    a break for twenty-three years.</p>
<p>It would be waste of space in this little
    book to go into the details of this long and
    wearisome war, which can be read in any
    history of Rome. It was, of course, in the
    main a naval war, and the Romans had as
    yet no fleet to speak of. But now was seen
    the advantage of a united Italy. The difficulty
    <span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
    was overcome by enlisting the services
    of Greek and Etruscan sailors and ship-builders;
    a Carthaginian war-vessel, wrecked
    on the Italian coast, served as a model, and
    a large fleet was soon ready for sea, with
    which, strange to say, the Roman commanders
    succeeded in the course of a few years in
    clearing the Italian and Sicilian seas of the
    enemy, and even contrived to transport an
    army of invasion to Carthaginian territory.
    This astonishing feat was accomplished
    simply by the invention of a device for grappling
    with the enemy’s ships, so that they
    could be boarded by Roman soldiers acting as
    “marines.” And during this first half of the
    war they also renewed their alliance with
    Hiero, and conquered the whole of Sicily, with
    the exception of the strong city of Lilybæum
    (now Marsala).</p>
<p>But all these good results were thrown away
    by the folly of the Roman Senate. Now that
    they had crossed the sea and entered on a
    new sphere of action, they seemed for the
    moment to have lost the prudence and wisdom
    that had won them the headship of Italy.
    They had two consular armies in Africa
    which seemed to have Carthage herself in
    <span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
    their grip; but when she sued for peace they
    offered her impossible terms, and about the
    same time actually recalled one of the two
    consuls with his army to Italy. The old
    Phœnician spirit revived, and turned to desperate
    courage: an able Greek soldier of
    fortune, Xanthippus, took the Carthaginian
    army in hand, and before long, the remaining
    Roman army was utterly destroyed and its
    commander Regulus was a prisoner. This
    is the Regulus of one of the most famous of
    Roman stories, and one of the most beautiful
    of Horace’s <i>Odes</i>. He is said to have gone
    to Rome on <i>parole</i> with an embassy, and
    on its failure to have returned a captive to
    Carthage, where he was put to a cruel death.
    Many critics now reject this tale as pure
    legend, without sufficient reason. It is probably
    true in outline, and it is certain that it
    took firm possession of the Roman mind.
    It thus bears witness to the strong Roman
    feeling of the binding power of an oath, even
    when given to an enemy; for Regulus had
    sworn to return if the mission failed.</p>
<p>It took Rome many years and enormous
    efforts to recover from this disaster, and from
    the destruction of her fleets by tempests
    <span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
    which unluckily followed and gave Carthage
    once more the mastery of the sea. Carthage,
    too, had found a man of genius, Hamilcar
    Barca, whose intense hatred of Rome, ever
    growing as she gradually prevailed, inspired
    his people to continue the struggle by sea,
    and his own forces to hold on grimly to a
    mountain fortress in the north-west of Sicily,
    Mount Eryx, the scene of the games in the
    fifth book of Virgil’s <i>Æneid</i>. Both sides were
    exhausted and indeed permanently damaged;
    but the strength of Rome was more enduring,
    and in 241 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Hamilcar consented himself
    to negotiate a peace, by which Sicily and
    the adjacent smaller islands passed into the
    hands of Rome for ever. Soon afterwards,
    taking advantage of a deadly war which
    Carthage had to wage with her own mercenaries,
    Rome contrived, in that spirit of
    “slimness” already noticed, to get possession
    of both Sardinia and Corsica. This shows
    that the Senate understood the importance
    of these islands for a power in command of
    the western seas; but unjust dealing brought
    its own reward. It is possible that the great
    Hamilcar might have forgiven Rome her
    injuries to his country but for this. As it
    <span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
    was, his hatred of her sunk into his soul more
    deeply than ever, and that hatred, springing
    up afresh in the breast of his son Hannibal,
    all but destroyed his enemy off the face of
    the earth. He retired to Spain, to organise
    a Carthaginian dominion there, of which he
    was himself practically king, and which he
    destined as a base of operations against Rome
    in another war; and before he started, as
    Hannibal himself told the story long afterwards,
    the father made his boy of nine years
    old take a solemn oath to cherish an eternal
    hatred of the enemies of his country.</p>
<p>The plan of invading Italy from Spain
    was forced upon Hamilcar by the fact that
    Rome was in command of the sea; it was no
    longer possible for Carthage to strike at her
    from Africa without a greater effort to recover
    that command than her government of merchant
    princes was now disposed to make.
    And the fact that Hannibal was actually
    able to carry out the invasion by land was due
    to the genius and personal influence of his
    father in building up a solid dominion in
    southern Spain with New Carthage (now
    Cartagena) as its capital. Some historians
    have thought that of these two extraordinary
    <span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
    men the father was the greatest; and it is
    at least true that his was a noble work of
    construction, while his son’s brilliant gifts
    were wasted in the attempt to destroy the
    great fabric which Rome had reared in Italy.
    The attempt was unavailing; the solid Roman
    structure survived all the assaults of the
    greatest captain of the ancient world. The
    glamour of Hannibal’s splendid victories
    must not blind us to the fact that he made
    two serious miscalculations: he believed that
    the Italians hated Rome as he did himself,
    and would join him to crush her; and he
    hoped, if he did not believe, that Carthage
    would give him substantial help. Had he
    judged rightly on the former point, Rome’s
    fate was sealed. But the Italian kinsmen of
    Rome, who had come to recognise in her their
    natural leader, never even faltered in their
    loyalty,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_5">[5]</a> and
    Carthage did but little to help
    him till it was too late. Thus we have in
    this terrible war the strange spectacle of a
    single man of marvellous genius pitting himself
    against the whole strength of a united
    Italy with military resources, as we know
    <span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
    from the accurate Greek historian, Polybius,
    amounting to some 770,000 men capable of
    bearing arms.</p>
<p>Fascinating as we may find Hannibal’s
    wonderful career, much as we may admire
    his nobility of character, a sober judgment
    must lead to the conclusion that no great
    man ever did less for the good of his fellow-creatures.
    During the fifteen years of his
    stay in Italy he did irreparable damage to
    the fair peninsula, and he hardened the hearts
    of the Romans for all their future dealings
    with their foes. When at last he left it he
    was unable to save his own country, and
    spent his last years in exile, ever plotting
    against the enemy that had escaped him.
    A man who is actuated all his life through
    by a single motive of hatred and revenge,
    can never be reckoned among those who have
    done something for the benefit of humanity.</p>
<p>While Hannibal was gaining the loyalty
    of the southern Spaniards, and organising
    their resources, Rome was occupied in trying
    to extend her power over the Gauls settled
    in the plain of the Po, and so to make sure
    of her northern flank, as she had already
    secured Sicily in the south. The Senate
    <span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
    knew something of Hannibal’s design, and
    hoped to anticipate him in getting a hold
    on that valuable region, the strategical key
    to Italy. But here there was no question
    of gaining the loyalty of the tribes; the Gauls
    were restless and hostile, and had quite
    lately made another determined attempt to
    reach Rome; they actually came within
    three days’ march of the city before they
    were defeated in a great battle. In 219-218
    <span class="small">B.C.</span> Roman armies were still busy in driving
    roads northward, and planting two colonies,
    Placentia and Cremona, on Gallic soil and on
    the Po, when Hannibal descended on them
    from the Alps. He had found a pretext for
    war, gathered a force of 100,000 men, passed
    the Pyrenees and reached the Rhone before
    the Senate knew what he was about, and
    eluded a consular army dispatched to stop
    him. Scipio, its commander, with true military
    instinct, sent his army on to Spain,
    to cut his communications with the base
    he had been preparing so long. This line of
    communication Hannibal never recovered for
    ten years, and was forced to maintain and
    recruit his army on Italian soil.</p>
<p>That army, from a purely military point
    <span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
    of view, was without doubt one of the best
    known to history. It consisted chiefly of
    thoroughly trained Spanish infantry, officered
    by Carthaginians, and of the best cavalry
    in the world, recruited from the Numidians
    of the western region of North Africa. It
    was one of those armies that can go anywhere
    and do anything at the bidding of its general,
    because entire trust in him was the one
    motive actuating it. It was a professional
    army, a perfect instrument of war, a weapon
    admirably fitted to destroy, but without constructive
    value—with no sap of civilisation
    giving it permanent vital energy. Luckily
    for Rome, this army had shrunk to very
    moderate dimensions when it reached Italy;
    the length of the march, the necessity of
    leaving some troops in Spain, and the terrible
    trials of the crossing of the Alps, where the
    native tribes combined with rock, snow and
    ice to wear it out, had reduced it to less than
    30,000 men.</p>
<p>Yet after a few days’ rest Hannibal went
    straight for the nearest Roman force. This
    force was now on the north bank of the Po
    under Scipio, who had returned from the
    Rhone to Italy. Pushing it back to the new
    <span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
    colony of Placentia, where it was joined by
    that of the other consul Sempronius, Hannibal
    utterly defeated the combined Roman
    armies on the little river Trebbia which runs
    down to that city (now Piacenza) from the
    Apennines. The Roman power in the plain
    of the Po was instantly paralysed by this
    defeat, and the victor at once set himself to
    organise alliances with the Gallic tribes while
    he rested and recruited his weary troops. But
    from the Gauls he got no substantial help;
    that fickle people had no great reason to welcome
    an invader when once he was in their
    territory. And perhaps this was fortunate
    for him; for if he had marched into central
    Italy as leader of a Gallic army he would have
    strengthened, not weakened, the resistance of
    the whole Italian federation that Rome had
    so solidly organised. His knowledge of the
    motives which held this federation together
    must surely have been seriously imperfect.</p>
<p>But in the spring he crossed the Apennines,
    and made his way through the marshy and
    malarious district around the lower Arno,
    where it is said he lost an eye from ophthalmia,
    to meet the consul Flaminius, who had
    been sent to cover the approach to Rome
    <span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
    with a large army. Slipping past Flaminius,
    Hannibal concealed his army among the hills
    and woods on the eastern shore of the lake
    of Trasimene, along the western bank of which
    the railway now runs on its way from Florence
    to Rome; and here he lay in wait for
    his prey. Flaminius walked into the trap
    laid for him; his army was totally destroyed,
    and he himself was killed. There was now
    nothing to stop the conqueror if he chose to
    march straight on Rome.</p>
<p>But Hannibal’s plans did not include a
    siege of Rome; he had brought no siege
    apparatus, and at no time during the war
    did he succeed in getting any from Carthage,
    or in making it in Italy. His real object
    was to bring the Italians over to his side,
    to isolate Rome, and to put a free Italy (so
    he is said to have phrased it) in place of a
    Roman dominion. So he turned his back
    on Rome, and made his way at leisure down
    the eastern coast of central Italy to the corn-lands
    of Apulia, which were henceforward
    to serve as his chief base of operations.
    Hence he might easily reach the great sea-ports
    of Tarentum and Croton, and so get
    into touch once more with Carthage, and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
    perhaps, too, with another power from whom
    he was already looking for help, Philip, king
    of Macedon. But during this southward
    march he learnt, apparently for the first
    time, that Italy was studded with Roman and
    Latin colonies, each a fortress, each provisioned
    and ready to resist him: each, too,
    a miniature Rome, disseminating among the
    Italians the honour and pride of Roman
    citizenship, and the animating spirit of Italian
    unity under Roman leadership. One or
    two of these fortresses he vainly tried to
    take, and he must at this time have begun at
    last to realise that the mortal hatred of an individual
    is no match in the long run for the
    organised vitality of a practical people.</p>
<p>His one chance was to win another great
    battle, and so to overawe south Italy, to make
    his base absolutely secure, and to force
    gradually northward the leaven of anti-Roman
    feeling on which he calculated. For
    the rest of that year, 217 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, he could not
    get this chance; the Senate, still cool-headed,
    had appointed a cool-headed dictator,<a class="fn" id="fr_6"
                                            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_6">[6]</a>
    who
    knew that his slow and steady citizen soldiers
    <span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
    were no good match for a mobile professional
    army skilfully handled, and steadily refused
    to accept battle. Not even when Hannibal
    forced his way northward to the rich plain
    of Campania, and tried to gain over the
    wealthy city of Capua, would Fabius be
    tempted to fight; he dogged the enemy’s
    footsteps, and once tried to catch him in a
    snare, from which Hannibal escaped by a
    clever ruse. But next year the Senate dispatched
    the two new consuls, with an army
    not far short of 100,000 men, to deal with
    the enemy in southern Italy; and here, reluctant
    though one at least of them was, Hannibal
    enticed them into a battle by seizing a
    valuable dépôt of stores at a town called
    Cannæ, near the sea, in the plain of Apulia.
    Though far inferior in numbers, he contrived
    by consummate tactics to draw the solid
    Roman legions into a net, and then used his
    mobile Numidian cavalry to prevent their
    escape to the rear. The fight became a
    butchery, in which 80,000 Romans are said
    to have fallen. The largest army ever yet
    sent out from Rome was totally destroyed,
    and it would seem as if she could no longer
    escape from her deadly foe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>At this point, the high-water mark of
    Hannibal’s successes, we may pause to see
    how the Senate met the news of this most
    terrible disaster. At no moment in Roman
    history is the sterling quality of the Roman
    character and spirit so conspicuously shown.
    The Senate had to meet not only the immediate
    military crisis in Italy, but the problems
    of military and naval policy in Spain, in
    Sicily, and in the plain of the Po. At home,
    too, they had to deal with what we may call
    a religious panic; the people, and especially
    the women, were beginning to lose nerve,
    and to fancy that their gods had forsaken
    them. We can believe the Roman historian
    when he says that any other people would
    have been crushed by a catastrophe like this.
    But the wise men of the Senate simply sat
    down to repair it, never dreaming of giving
    in. The city was made safe, fresh legions
    were enrolled, and thanks were voted to
    the surviving consul “for not despairing of
    the republic.” They would not ransom the
    prisoners in Hannibal’s hands, nor receive
    the officer whom he sent for this purpose.
    They were not moved even by the news that
    southern Italy, the Bruttians, Lucanians,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
    Apulians, and most of the Samnites, had
    joined the enemy, and that isolated towns
    farther north had deserted them. Capua,
    the second city of Italy, was betrayed to
    Hannibal, and he was thus enabled to advance
    his base from Apulia into the plain of Campania,
    without leaving an enemy in his rear:
    but the Senate did not despair. In due time
    the ranks of this Senate, sadly thinned since
    the war began, were filled up by a dictator
    with the best and most experienced citizens
    available. All possible means were adopted
    of keeping up the idea of “the peace of the
    gods”; an embassy was even sent to Delphi;
    the religious panic speedily quieted down.
    At the beginning of the next year provision
    was made as usual for the military commands
    in Sicily, Sardinia, and Spain, and also for
    a fleet which was being got together at Ostia,
    the port at the mouth of the Tiber. Within
    a few months after the battle all was going
    on in Rome as usual.</p>
<p>So the overwhelming defeat of Cannæ did
    but lead the Romans to victory—to a victory
    of all the nobler elements in their character
    over momentary doubt and despair. A
    people that could recover from that disaster,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
    and go quietly about the work of repairing it,
    was not likely to be crushed out of existence
    even by a Hannibal; and though he was to
    remain as a standing menace for many years
    on Italian soil, it may fairly be said that
    henceforward he had no real chance of ultimate
    success. Two moments of grave anxiety
    were still to come, but Rome survived them
    both. One of these came three years later,
    when a desperate effort was being made to
    snatch Capua out of Hannibal’s grasp. To
    induce the Roman government to raise the
    siege, he made a sudden march on Rome,
    knowing that no covering army was between
    him and the capital. He encamped on the
    Anio, three miles above the city, and rode
    with an escort of cavalry right up to the gates.
    But it was all in vain; the Senate had gathered
    levies amply sufficient to hold the walls,
    and after plundering the Roman lands Hannibal
    fell away again, like a sea-wave spent
    and broken on a rocky shore.</p>
<p>The last moment of extreme peril came
    five years later, in 207 <span class="small">B.C.</span> The wise foresight
    of the Senate at the outset of the war
    had so far secured the Roman hold on Spain,
    and no reinforcements had reached Hannibal
    <span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
    from that source. At last his loyal and able
    brother Hasdrubal eluded the Roman army
    there, and by taking a new route—that of
    Wellington in the Peninsular War—avoided
    all opposition from the Romans in northern
    Spain. Communications with Italy were now
    at last open, though not by sea, as they should
    have been had the government at Carthage
    thrown its whole strength into the work of
    building up its naval power afresh. Hasdrubal
    was forced to cross the Alps, and this
    he did with better knowledge and with less
    loss than his brother. He made his way
    through the Gallic territory and reached
    Ariminum (Rimini). Hannibal was in Apulia,
    where one consul was holding him in check
    and dealing with disaffected Italians; the
    other was waiting for the invader on the
    great coast road south of Ariminum. Hasdrubal
    sent dispatches to his brother informing
    him of his arrival and suggesting plans
    of co-operation; but there were Roman troops
    everywhere, and the messengers fell into
    the hands of the enemy. The consul in the
    south, Claudius Nero, discovering thus the
    danger, took a step, without orders from
    the Senate, which has made his name for
    <span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
    ever famous. He left sufficient force to hold
    Hannibal, and slipped away with 7000
    picked men, without being discovered even
    by the most wily of commanders. He
    marched into the camp of Livius, the other
    consul, by night, after a march of some 200
    miles, all the loyal people of central Italy
    feeding and blessing his army as he went.
    Two days later the most decisive battle of
    the war was fought on the banks of the little
    river Metaurus, which runs into the sea from
    the Apennines a few miles south of Ariminum.
    The Romans were this time completely
    victorious; the invading army was utterly
    destroyed, and Hasdrubal was killed fighting
    hard to the last. Nero went swiftly southwards
    to his original station, and flung the
    head of Hasdrubal—so it was said—into his
    brother’s camp. For the first time during the
    long weary years of the war Rome was mad
    with joy; and almost for the first time in her
    history we note a genuine outburst of gratitude
    to the gods for this their inestimable
    blessing. Gratitude, whether to god or man,
    was not a conspicuous trait in the Roman
    character; but now, in a moment of real
    religious emotion, the first thought is one of
    <span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
    thankfulness that “the peace of the gods”
    is fully restored. It was not only that the
    Senate ordered a public thanksgiving of three
    days, but that men and women alike took
    advantage of it to press in crowds to the
    temples, the mothers, in their finest robes,
    bringing their children with them.</p>
<p>The rest of the war-story is soon told. The
    man who had let Hasdrubal escape him in
    Spain was a young Scipio, son of a Scipio
    who had done good work and lost his life
    there earlier in the war. He himself was a
    young man of real ability, whose character
    has always been to some extent a mystery.
    He was a new type of Roman, one not wholly
    without imagination, and the long years that
    he spent in Spain without rivals to check him
    had perhaps made him cherish and develop
    his own individuality more than was possible
    for the staid Roman noble of the old type
    at home. He believed profoundly in himself,
    and had the gift of making others believe in
    him. Returning home the year after the
    Metaurus battle, he was elected consul,
    though not yet of the legal age, and had Sicily
    given him as his province, where after many
    vicissitudes the Romans were now supreme.
    <span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
    He at once proposed to invade Africa, and so
    to force Hannibal to leave Italy; and the
    Senate, though they could not or would not
    risk a large force, gave him leave to make
    the attempt.</p>
<p>Scipio crossed to Africa in 204 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and ere
    long the Carthaginian government recalled
    Hannibal. The great general obeyed, sadly
    and unwillingly, and in 202 met Scipio in
    battle at Zama and was beaten; the undisciplined
    levies given him by the government
    were no match for Roman veterans. He
    himself now advised his people to make peace,
    and conducted the negotiations, thus doing
    what he could to make up for the irreparable
    damage done her in the war by his own
    implacable hatred of her rival. Carthage
    was no longer to be a naval power—that was
    definitely secured by the terms accorded her.
    She surrendered Spain to the victors, and
    agreed to pay a large war indemnity by
    instalments during fifty successive years.
    Her foreign policy was to be guided by Rome:
    she could no longer be called an independent
    State.</p>
<p>So ended this great trial of Roman endurance.
    No people has ever gone through a
    <span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
    harder test and survived. The sense of duty
    and discipline never once failed them; Romans
    and Italians alike were ready to face death
    at any moment in defence of their country.
    But war, always mischievous, when prolonged
    can sow the seeds of much evil in
    the future; and we must confess with regret
    that we are to see but little more of the heroic
    qualities that had carried Rome through this
    great struggle.</p>

<p>“It was not merely that the disasters of
    the war had opened the eyes of public men to
    abuses which had grown up among them; it
    was not that they hastened to take measures
    by which such disasters might be prevented
    from occurring again. Not so much foresight
    as this was required. The question
    was at once simpler and more urgently pressing:
    it was how to prevent the cultivation
    of the country from falling into a condition
    of permanent decay.... Not only did it
    become necessary to inquire of political
    economy what means there were of increasing
    the wealth of a whole nation at once, but
    other reforms, less obviously adapted to the
    immediate need, were now eagerly carried
    into effect.”<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_7">[7]</a>
</p>
<p>This passage does not refer to Italy and
    the Roman government after the great war,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
    but to Prussia after she had succumbed to
    Napoleon and was forced to rest from sheer
    exhaustion. This rest, skilfully used by
    statesmen of genius, meant for Prussia recovery,
    and the opening of a great era of
    prosperity. If Rome in like manner could
    have given rest to a weary Italy, and brought
    all her practical skill to bear on the work of
    healing and mending, the next two centuries
    might have been far happier ones for her and
    for the world. But it is hard for young
    nations, as for young men, to realise the
    need of rest, and all the harder in ancient
    Italy, where fighting had hardly ceased to
    be looked on as “the natural industry of a
    vigorous State.” The Roman Senate was not
    ripe enough in knowledge of human nature
    to understand the mischief, moral as well as
    material, that a long war can cause, especially
    if the enemy has been in your country harrying
    and devouring, no one knowing when his
    turn will come to be ruined. And, indeed,
    we may doubt whether even if Rome’s leading
    men had been able to understand the nature
    of the mischief, they would have had the
    skill to discover and apply the necessary
    remedies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>This mischief and its results must be the
    subject of this chapter, for without getting
    some idea of it we cannot understand the
    perils to which civilisation was exposed in
    the next two hundred years by Roman
    degeneracy, or the way in which they were
    eventually overcome. But I must just glance,
    to start with, at the policy actually pursued
    by the Senate in the period following the war,
    which placed Rome in the position of arbiter
    of the whole Mediterranean world, and mistress
    of a territory many times as large as
    Italy.</p>
<p>The two recent invasions of Italy by formidable
    enemies must have taught the Senate
    the necessity of making it impossible that
    there should be another. But another might
    yet be looked for—so at least they believed—not
    from Spain or Africa, but from the great
    military power of Macedon. Philip of Macedon
    had been among Rome’s enemies since
    Cannæ; but not even Hannibal could persuade
    him to attack her with vigour, and he
    missed his chance. Roman diplomacy had
    stirred up the Greeks against him, and he had
    plenty to do at home. But no sooner was
    Carthage crushed than the Senate coaxed the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
    tired and unwilling people into declaring
    war against him, and this led in the course of
    the next half-century to the overthrow of the
    Macedonian kingdom, and finally to its
    absorption into what we must now begin to
    call the Roman Empire. At the same time,
    Rome acquired a protectorate over the whole
    of Greece, at first honestly meant to defend
    her against Macedon, but destined to pass
    rapidly into dominion. The Greeks in their
    leagues and cities were never again really
    free. If they could have kept from quarrelling
    among themselves, they might have
    endured this protectorate with profit; but
    ere Rome had done with them they were
    to feel her heavy hand.</p>
<p>Thus the “peasants of the Tiber” became
    masters of the Balkan peninsula as well as of
    that of Italy. In the same period they completed
    the conquest of Italy up to the Alps,
    not without difficulties and defeats, and went
    on driving their roads and planting colonies
    in all parts. In the Spanish peninsula, from
    which the Carthaginians had been finally
    driven, they now established two permanent
    commands (<i>provinciæ</i>), one in the basin of
    the Ebro in the north-east, and the other
    <span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
    in the fertile valleys of the Guadiana and
    Guadalquivir, as the two great rivers of
    southern Spain are now called. From these
    they slowly but persistently, after their manner,
    and in spite of many defeats and even
    disgraces, pushed up into the high tablelands
    of central Spain, until they had brought the
    greater part of the peninsula under their
    sway. Here they had to deal with a people
    very different from the weary and exhausted
    Greeks and Macedonians; a people only half
    civilised, but lively, intelligent and capable
    of making excellent soldiers, as Hannibal
    had found. It is to the credit of the Romans
    that, in spite of much cruelty and misgovernment,
    they gave this peninsula a real civilisation,
    of which the traces are still abundant
    especially in the south, and a beautiful
    language, which descends directly from their
    own.</p>
<p>In order to maintain their communications
    with Spain by land as well as by sea, they
    also had to look to the coast between the
    western Alps and the Pyrenees. Here they
    made a lasting alliance with the ancient and
    flourishing Greek colony, Massilia (Marseille);
    and in defending Massilia from the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
    attacks of mountain tribes they were gradually
    drawn into the acquisition of a permanent
    hold on the lower valley of the Rhone. This,
    again, in due time very naturally became
    the starting-point for fresh advance into the
    heart of modern France. No one who has
    seen the Rhone from Lyons to Marseilles can
    resist the conclusion that a power in possession
    of its lower reaches must inevitably advance
    along it northward.</p>
<p>There is yet a fourth peninsula in this
    land-locked sea, known for want of a better
    name as Asia Minor, which juts out from the
    Asiatic continent, and forms a meeting-place
    for Eastern and Western civilisations. This
    was in the last three centuries <span class="small">B.C.</span> the fighting-ground
    of the successors of Alexander the
    Great, kings of Macedon, Pergamum, Syria
    and Egypt, who wasted the vigour of humanity
    in wars that to us seem needless. The
    Romans were soon drawn into a war with
    the king of Syria, an ally of Philip of Macedon,
    and won a great victory in this peninsula
    in the year 190 <span class="small">B.C.</span> But they annexed no
    territory here until the last king of Pergamum
    left his kingdom to Rome by will
    some sixty years later. The Senate preferred
    <span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
    to act as arbitrator, to make alliances,
    to reward friendly states, to use diplomacy
    rather than force; and on the whole they
    succeeded. Their policy was often tortuous,
    sometimes even mean, but in the long run it
    did more good than harm to humanity that
    a young and virile people should interfere
    among these monarchies.</p>
<p>Thus, whether we look west or east in the
    Mediterranean, we find the Roman power
    predominant everywhere within eighty years
    from the end of the war with Hannibal. It
    is not easy to explain in a few words what
    drove this power onwards. It was not simply
    the commercial motive, as with Carthage.
    It was not simply the desire to conquer
    and annex, for the Senate was slow to undertake
    new duties of government abroad if
    their object could be attained in some other
    way. But what was that object? Undoubtedly
    it was self-defence to begin with;
    but self-defence, once successful, only too
    easily slips into self-assertion. This self-assertion,
    as we see it in Roman policy, may
    perhaps be compared with that which governs
    German foreign policy now—the determination
    to have a voice in all matters within her
    <span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
    “sphere of interest.” No Roman senator
    had a doubt that his people were the strongest
    and most competent to control the world,
    which is exactly what the patriotic German
    believes now. And the constant assertion
    of this proud conviction brought many suitors
    and suppliants to Rome, whose presence
    flattered Roman pride, and whose diplomacy
    sometimes involved the government in new
    wars, giving ambitious consuls their opportunity
    of increasing the fame and the wealth
    of themselves and their families. So in due
    time there arose a dominion of the following
    military commands or provinces: one in
    Sicily, one in Sardinia, two in Spain, one in
    southern Gaul, one in Macedonia with Greece
    attached to it, one in Asia Minor, and one
    in Africa, after the destruction of Carthage
    by her old enemy in 146 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Of the method
    of governing these provinces I will say something
    in another chapter. Now let us try to
    estimate some of the results of these continuous
    wars in distant parts, taken together
    with the long struggle with Carthage. We
    shall find a change in every department of
    the people’s life, and in almost all a change
    for the worse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>First, let us look at that family life which
    formed the essential fibre of the old body
    politic, and provided the most powerful
    factor in the Roman character. We have
    but to think of the immense numbers of
    citizens killed or captured in war, or carried
    off by the pestilences that always follow war,
    to see what paralysis of family life there must
    have been. Fathers and grown-up sons innumerable
    never came home at all; and long
    service far from home would, in any case,
    deprive the family of the natural influence
    and authority of its head. Mothers might do
    much to fill up the gap, and the tradition of
    the dignified and righteous Roman lady was
    not as yet wholly weakened; but there are
    signs that the women in this period were
    getting steadily more excitable, more self-asserting,
    more luxurious. It is in this age
    that divorce begins to make its appearance,
    a sure sign of the decay of the old family
    life. There were rumours, too, of the poisoning
    of husbands by their wives, and on one
    occasion two noble ladies were put to death
    for this crime by the verdict of a council of
    relations. In an extraordinary attempt to
    introduce into Italy the exciting orgies of
    <span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
    the Greek religion of Dionysus, women were
    among the most prominent offenders. The
    changing position of women at this time
    is illustrated by a famous saying of Cato,
    that “all men rule over women, we Romans
    rule over all men, and our wives rule over
    us.”</p>
<p>With the decay of the old family life, the
    wholesome training of the children in manly
    conduct (<i>virtus</i>) and sense of duty (<i>pietas</i>)
    could not but suffer, too. Old-fashioned
    families would keep it up, but among the
    lower classes it was hard to do so owing to
    bad housing and crowding in the city; and
    in the noble families there was undoubtedly a
    change for the worse, though we know of one
    or two great men of this age who took pains
    with the moral as well as the intellectual
    training of their boys.<a class="fn" id="fr_8"
                              href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_8">[8]</a> For a people
    controlling
    the Mediterranean world it was necessary
    to educate the mental faculties, and
    more especially to teach a boy to speak and
    read Greek, which was the language of half
    the civilised world, and the language of commerce
    <span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
    everywhere. Now Rome could not
    supply teachers for this kind of education;
    Romans were not competent, nor would they
    have condescended to such work. The Greeks
    were the one people who could undertake
    what we call the higher education, and they
    were now beginning to swarm in Rome.
    Some Greek teachers were free men, but the
    greater number were slaves captured in the
    wars; and thus the first requisite in a school-master,
    that he should be looked up to and
    willingly obeyed, was too often absent in this
    new education. It is men, not methods, that
    really tell in education. In his heart, as we
    know from many striking passages in Roman
    literature, the grown-up Roman despised the
    Greek, and we may be sure that the Roman
    boy did too. Greek literature and rhetoric,
    now fast becoming the staple of the higher
    education, could never make up for the lack
    of moral discipline. If we find a spirit of lawlessness
    in the coming age, and a want of
    self-restraint in dealing with enemies or opponents,
    we shall not be far wrong in ascribing
    it in great part to the loss of the wholesome
    home influence, and to the introduction of an
    education outside the home, which entirely
    <span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
    failed to make up for the decay of the simple
    old training in duty and discipline.</p>
<p>The fact is that the Romans were now
    coming under the influence of a new idea of
    life, in which the individual played a more
    important part than ever before at Rome.
    The Roman of the past had grown up
    modelled on a type and fixed in a group, so
    that the individual had little chance of asserting
    himself; but now we find him asserting
    himself in every direction, and in every class
    of society. To think for oneself, even in
    matters of religion; to speak from personal
    motives in the senate or law-courts; to aim
    at one’s own advancement in position or
    wealth—all this seemed natural and inevitable
    to the men of that day. And so by
    degrees the individual became the mainspring
    of action instead of the State. There were
    some noble exceptions, but most of the leading
    men played their own game, and often won
    it at the expense of the State. Many a general
    hurried on operations towards the close of his
    command so as not to be superseded before he
    could earn a triumph, and pass in splendid
    procession up to the temple on the Capitol,
    with chained captives following his chariot.
    <span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
    And the small men became more and more
    unwilling to serve as soldiers in distant lands,
    and more and more rebellious against discipline.
    In little more than half-a-century
    after Hannibal had left Italy the Roman
    armies were beginning to be incapable of their
    work.</p>
<p>Along with this too rapid growth of the
    individual, we have to take account of the
    sudden incoming of wealth and growth of
    capital. The old Roman family group had
    no capital except its land and stock. But
    now, as the result of plunder and extortion
    in the provinces, most men of the upper
    classes had some capital in money, and this
    was almost always invested in public works
    and State undertakings of all kinds, <i>e.g.</i> the
    raising of taxes and the fitting out of fleets
    and armies. These things were all done by
    contract, and the contracts were taken by
    companies, in which every man was a shareholder
    who had anything to invest. Thus
    the inflow of wealth brought with it the desire
    of making money, and the forum of Rome
    became a kind of stock-exchange in which
    the buying and selling of shares was always
    going on, and where every man was trying
    <span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
    to outwit his neighbour. Of a really productive
    use of capital in industry or commerce
    we hear very little; and it would seem that
    the Roman of that day had no idea of using
    his means or opportunities in ways likely to
    produce well-being in the world.</p>
<p>If we turn to rural Italy, the prospect is
    hardly less dreary. Incalculable damage had
    been done to agriculture in the great war,
    and agriculture, in the broad sense of the
    word, was almost the only Italian industry.
    Corn, wine, oil, wool and leather had formerly
    been produced in sufficient quantities to keep
    the inhabitants in food and clothing, each
    community growing what it needed, as in
    mediæval England. But this simple form of
    agricultural economy must have suffered a
    severe shock, not only from the ravages of
    armies, but from the decrease of the working
    population owing to war and pestilence.</p>
<p>In order to restore a decaying industry
    you must have the men to work it. Depopulation
    as the result mainly of war was
    a disease epidemic in the Mediterranean in
    this age; and in Italy we know for certain
    how rife it was, for we have the records of
    the census of the body of Roman citizens,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
    which show a steady falling-off in this period,
    and we must suppose that the same causes
    were at work among the non-Roman population
    of the peninsula. There was, indeed,
    a remedy, but it was almost worse than the
    disease—I mean the vast numbers of slaves
    now available for labour. The unskilled
    slaves, captured or kidnapped in Spain, Gaul,
    Epirus, Thrace or Asia Minor, were cheap
    in the Roman market, and would do well
    enough to run a farm with, especially if that
    farm were chiefly a pastoral one, with flocks
    and herds needing no great experience or
    skill to look after. This cheapness, and the
    physical conditions of rural life in a mountainous
    country, made cattle-running and
    sheep-tending a profitable industry. Large
    districts of Italy, especially in the centre and
    south, became covered in this period with
    huge estates owned by capitalists, and
    worked by rough and often savage slaves,
    who were locked up at night in underground
    prisons and treated simply as “living tools.”
    No ray of hope ever broke in on these miserable
    beings; no free citizen gave a thought
    either to their condition or the economic
    danger of the system; philanthropy and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
    political economy were unknown in the
    Roman world, for imagination and reflection
    were alike foreign to the Roman mental
    habit</p>
<p>Even on the estates of moderate size which
    were not entirely pastoral, slave-labour was
    the rule. We know something of such a
    farm from the treatise on agriculture written
    by Cato at this time, which has come down
    to us entire; and it is plain from what he says
    that though free labour might be employed
    at certain seasons, <i>e.g.</i> at harvest, the economic
    basis of the business was slave-labour.
    There is no doubt that all over Italy the
    small farm and the free cultivator were fast
    disappearing, with the rapid growth of capital
    and the cheapness of slaves. In the city of
    Rome, now beginning to harbour a vast population
    of many races, the number of domestic
    slaves tended constantly to increase;
    they were employed in every capacity by men
    of wealth and business. Many of them were
    cultivated men, Greeks for example, who
    could act as clerks, secretaries or teachers,
    and these had a fair chance of earning their
    freedom in time; but great numbers were
    low and vicious beings, who had no moral
    <span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
    standard but that of obedience to a master,
    no moral sanction except punishment.</p>
<p>Thus, though the shrinkage of the free
    population was evil enough, the remedy for
    it was even worse. The slave, plucked up
    by the roots from the soil in which he had
    flourished in his native land, deprived of
    family, property, religion, must in the majority
    of cases become a demoralised and
    hopeless being. In the plays of Plautus,
    which date from this period, the slave is a
    liar and a thief, and apparently without a
    conscience. For the slave-owner, too, the
    moral results were bad enough, though not
    so obvious at first sight. A man who is
    served by scores of fellow-creatures who are
    absolutely at his mercy is liable to have his
    sense of duty gradually paralysed. Towards
    them he has no obligations, only rights; and
    thus his sense of duty towards his free fellow-citizens
    is apt to be paralysed too. A habit
    of mind acquired in dealing with one set of
    men naturally extends itself and affects all
    human relations. And so the Roman character,
    naturally hard enough, came in the
    later days of the Republic to be harder than
    ever. In our next two chapters we shall meet
    <span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
    with unmistakable proofs of this. Incredible
    cruelty, recklessness of human life, callousness
    in dealing with the vanquished and the
    subject peoples, meet us at every turn in that
    dark age of Mediterranean history. Under
    the baleful influence of slavery the hard
    Roman nature had become brutalised; and
    we have to wait for the Christian era before
    we find any sign of sympathy with that vast
    mass of suffering humanity with which the
    Roman dominion was populated.</p>
<p>We must glance in the last place at the
    change brought about by the wars in another
    department of Roman life, viz. in the working
    of the constitution. The reader will remember
    that in early Rome the salient feature in
    that constitution was the <i>imperium</i> of the
    magistrate, just as in private life the salient
    feature was the discipline of the family under
    the rule of the head of the household. The
    man who held the <i>imperium</i> was irresistible
    so long as he held it, though a wise custom
    made it necessary for him to seek the advice
    of his council, the Senate, in all questions
    of grave importance. But now the long wars
    took the consul and his <i>imperium</i> away from
    the city for long periods, and as the Empire
    <span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
    began to grow up and include provinces
    beyond sea, those periods became longer and
    longer. There were, indeed, always two
    magistrates with <i>imperium</i> in Rome, the
    prætors, who for long past had been elected
    yearly to help the consuls in judicial business;
    but the prestige of their <i>imperium</i> never
    reached the level of that of the consuls.
    And even when a consul returned home,
    though the majesty of the <i>imperium</i> was
    present in his person as ever, it was not his
    hand that was really on the helm. The decision
    of great questions did not lie with him,
    but with his Council, whose knowledge of
    affairs and whose “courage never to submit
    or yield,” had carried Rome safely through
    a long series of unexampled trials.</p>
<p>In the period after the war with Hannibal,
    the Senate, not the <i>imperium</i>, is clearly the
    paramount power in the working of the
    constitutional machinery. To take a single
    instance: when the people declined to sanction
    the war with Philip of Macedon, the
    Senate directed the consul to convince them
    that they were wrong, and both consul and
    people bowed to its will. They had other
    agents in the tribunes of the people, if the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
    consuls failed them, and would now and
    then even coerce a consul by means of the
    power of the tribune. But what chiefly gave
    the Senate its power was the fact that it was
    the only permanent part of the government.
    A senator held office for life unless ejected
    by the Censor for immorality, while all the
    magistrates were elected for a year only. In
    the Senate there sat for life every man who
    had held high office and done the State good
    service, and as there were some three hundred
    of these, it was almost impossible for the
    yearly holders of <i>imperium</i> to resist their
    deliberate judgments. And for those judgments
    the Senate was responsible to no man.</p>
<p>Probably no assembly has ever comprised
    so much practical wisdom and experience as
    the Roman Senate of this period; but that
    wisdom and that experience was limited to
    the working of the constitution, the control
    of foreign affairs, and the direction and supply
    of armies. As has already been hinted, when
    it came to providing remedies for economic
    and moral evils such as I have been sketching,
    the Senators were useless; they had no training
    in the art of the State physician, and no
    desire to learn how to diagnose disease. They
    <span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
    were almost all men of the same type, and
    with the same public and private interests.
    They belonged, in fact, to a few noble families,
    and new blood was seldom to be found in
    their ranks; for though they had all at one
    time or other been elected to office by the
    people, the choice of the people almost always
    fell upon members of the old tried families.
    The principle that the son of a family that has
    done good service to the State will be likely
    himself to do such service, seems to have
    taken firm hold of the mind of the Roman
    voter; and thus it came about that the Senate,
    in spite of its great capacity for business,
    gradually became an <i>oligarchical</i> body—the
    mouthpiece of one class of society. The
    principle is by no means a bad one in some
    stages of social growth, but it is sure in the
    long run to produce the vices as well as the
    virtues of oligarchy—the dislike of any kind
    of change, the narrow view of social life, the
    want of sympathy with other classes and of
    the desire to understand their needs. We
    shall see in the next two chapters how these
    oligarchical weaknesses brought the Senatorial
    government to an ignominious end. It
    had saved the State from its deadliest enemy;
    <span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
    it had laid the foundations of the Roman
    Empire; but it failed utterly when called on
    to do the nobler work of justice and humanity.</p>
<p>This aptly brings us to our last point in
    this chapter. As the Roman oligarchy stood
    to the people, so Rome herself stood as an
    oligarchy to the populations of her Empire.
    The Roman citizen was the one most highly
    privileged person in the civilised world of that
    day. The great prize of his citizenship was
    not, as we might suppose it would be, the
    right to vote in the assemblies, to choose
    magistrates and pass or reject laws, nor the
    right to hold office if elected, for to that distinction
    very few could aspire; it was really
    the legal protection of his person and his
    property wherever he might be in the Empire.
    No one could maltreat his person with impunity;
    a fact well illustrated in the life of St.
    Paul (Acts xxii. 25 foll.). He could do business
    everywhere with the certainty that his
    sales, purchases, contracts, would be recognised
    and defended by Roman law, while the
    non-citizen had no such guarantees for his
    transactions. No other city in the Mediterranean
    had a citizenship to compare with
    this in practical value, for the Roman law
    <span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
    was gradually becoming the only system of
    law with a real force behind it. To live a life
    of security and prosperity you must be a
    Roman citizen.</p>
<p>We, in these days of comparative enlightenment,
    might perhaps imagine that with a
    gift like this citizenship in their hands the
    Romans would have been quick to reward
    their faithful Italian allies, who had served
    in their armies all through these wars, by
    lifting them to their own level of social and
    political privilege. But if so, we should be
    ascribing to the human nature of Roman
    times a degree of generosity and sympathy
    which was, in fact, almost unknown. We
    might fancy that they would have grasped
    the fact that their old city-state had outgrown
    its cradle, that Italy and not the city
    of Rome now really supplied the force with
    which the world was ruled, and that they
    would put the Italians on the same level of
    advantage as themselves, at least as regards
    the protection of person and property. But
    after the war with Hannibal the tendency
    was rather in the other direction. All allied
    Italian cities continued to have to supply
    contingents to Roman armies and fleets; yet
    <span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
    Rome offered them no privileges to make up
    for these burdens, and her magistrates got
    more and more into the habit of treating
    them as inferiors. The Latins, too, that is
    the old cities of the Latin league, and the
    colonies with Latin <i>right</i>, as it was now called,
    who already had some of the privileges of
    citizenship, were carefully prevented from
    acquiring more, from becoming full citizens
    of Rome. In this exclusive policy, which
    seems to us mean and ungrateful, the Roman
    government undoubtedly lost a great chance,
    and had to pay dearly later on for her
    negligence.</p>
<p>The fact was that the imperial idea had
    taken hold of the governing Romans with
    a force to which that of our British “imperialism”
    cannot compare for a moment. They
    were so busy governing, negotiating, arbitrating
    and making money, that the condition
    and claims of their own city and country
    failed to attract the attention of any but a
    very few among the educated aristocracy.
    Depopulation, decline of agriculture, slavery
    and its accompanying evils, injustice to the
    Italian allies and the ever-growing discontent
    occasioned by it, misgovernment and plunder
    <span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
    in the provinces, all these sources of mischief
    were now accumulating force, and were before
    long to bring the whole Roman system to the
    brink of ruin. But Rome on the brink of
    ruin meant civilisation in imminent danger;
    for no other power could any longer withstand
    the barbarians of northern Europe,
    who were even now beginning to press down
    into sunny southern lands. So it is that
    the story of the succeeding century, the last
    before the Christian era, is one of the most
    thrilling interest. How did Rome survive
    and overcome these dangers with renewed
    strength, and succeed in organising an Empire
    on the firm foundations of law and justice,
    destined to hold the barbarians at bay long
    enough to inspire them with profound respect
    for the civilisation they were attacking?
    This question we will try to answer in the
    remaining chapters of this book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
    <br><span class="h2line2">THE REVOLUTION: ACT I</span></h2>
<p>Enough was said in the last chapter to
    show that the age we are now coming to, the
    last century before Christ, was one full of
    great issues—not only for Rome, but for all
    western civilisation. The perils threatening,
    both internal and external, were so real as
    to call for statesmen and soldiers of the
    highest quality; and as we shall see, this call
    was answered. It was this century that
    produced most of the famous Romans whose
    names are familiar to us: the two Gracchi,
    Marius, Sulla, Pompey, Cicero, Cæsar, and
    finally Augustus, all of whom helped in various
    ways to save Italy and the Empire from
    premature dissolution. It was, in fact, an age
    of great personalities, and one, too, in which
    personal character became as deeply interesting
    to the men of the time as it is even now
    to us. For as the disciplinary force of the
    State waned, the individual was left freer to
    <span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
    make his own force felt; and so great was that
    force at times, that we are tempted to fix our
    attention on the man, and to forget the
    complicated motives and interests of the
    world in which he was acting. Undoubtedly
    we should be wrong in doing so; for a very
    small acquaintance with the facts would
    show us these great men struggling incessantly
    with difficulties, and carried out of
    their own natural course by adverse currents.
    But none the less it is true that hardly any
    other period of history shows so much, for
    good and evil alike, depending on individual
    character. So as the last chapter dealt
    mainly with perils and problems, our next
    two will be occupied with the efforts of these
    famous men to meet the perils and solve the
    problems.</p>
<p>Depopulation and the decline of agriculture
    were the first of the perils to be considered
    seriously. This was done in the year 133 <span class="small">B.C.</span>,
    not by the Senate, whose business it really
    was, but by a young and enthusiastic noble,
    in some ways one of the finest characters in
    Roman history. Tiberius Gracchus had the
    right instinct of the old Roman for duty, and
    for a Roman he had an unusually tender and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
    generous nature; but he had not the experience
    and knowledge necessary for one who
    would take this difficult problem in hand,
    which in our day would be prepared for
    legislation by careful inquiry about facts,
    conducted by authorised experts. His education
    had been mainly Greek, and a study of
    hard facts did not form a part of it.</p>
<p>Still, he was able to enlist the help of some
    capable men, and produced and finally carried
    a bill which may be called a Small Holdings
    Act. No one was henceforward to hold more
    than 500 <i>jugera</i> (about 300 acres) of <i>public
        land</i>, or if he had sons, 250 more for each of
    two. Public land was land owned by the
    State, but occupied by private men who paid
    (or ought to have paid) rent for it in some
    form. Land owned as well as occupied by
    private men could not be touched; but there
    was abundance of the other, for the State had
    retained its hold on a large part of the land of
    Italy acquired by Rome. This land was now
    to be divided up in allotments, the State
    retaining its ownership and forbidding sale,
    a futile attempt to keep the settlers on the
    land, even against their will. This courageous
    plan for bringing the people back to the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
    land was put in action at once, and we still
    have a few of the inscribed boundary stones
    set up by the commissioners chosen to carry
    it out. And there is reason to believe that it
    did some good in regard both to depopulation
    and agriculture. The Senate made no serious
    attempt to interfere with it when once it was
    passed, and it continued in force for many
    years.</p>
<p>But unluckily the Senate had done all it
    could to prevent the bill passing; they would
    have nothing to say to it, and they put up a
    tribune to veto it. The veto of the tribune of
    the plebs was an essential part of the constitution,
    and could not be disregarded; but
    Gracchus, also a tribune, had but one year of
    office, and if he could not get his bill through
    during that year, he must give up the attempt
    for a long while. Enthusiasm got the better
    of prudence; he deliberately broke with law
    and usage; he defied the Senate and its prerogative,
    and he carried a bill deposing the
    tribune who acted for the Senate. He also
    proposed to offer himself as a candidate for re-election,
    contrary to the custom if not the law
    of the constitution. With the highest motives
    he thus laid himself open to the charge of
    <span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
    making himself master of the State, by
    violating the custom of its forefathers (<i>mos
        majorum</i>). It had always been a maxim of
    Roman law that the man who aimed at
    tyranny might be slain by any one; and
    now that even the best aristocrats believed
    Gracchus guilty, this was the fate that overtook
    him. He was killed on the Capitol, and
    the cowardly rabble made no attempt to save
    him.</p>
<p>The story is perhaps the saddest in Roman
    history. A little more patience and practical
    wisdom, a little more of the spirit of compromise
    on either side, might have saved the
    situation. The old Roman discipline had
    avoided violence, and got over constitutional
    difficulties by consent; now Gracchus laid
    a violent hand on the constitution, and was
    repaid with violence by its unworthy defenders.
    Intending only reform, he ended
    with starting revolution.</p>
<p>There was another enemy within the gates
    beside depopulation, one not less to be feared,
    but less easy to realise as an enemy; I mean
    slave-labour. Gracchus may be pardoned for
    making no direct attempt to attack it, though
    just before his tribunate there had been a
    <span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
    rising of slaves in Sicily which showed the
    military as well as the economic danger of
    the situation. It is said that 200,000 slaves
    were in rebellion there at one time, and the
    war was only ended after a long struggle.
    These risings, more of which followed at
    intervals, and finally a most formidable one
    in Italy sixty years later, were symptoms of
    a disease calling for a very skilful physician;
    but no physician was to be found until Cæsar
    tried to make a beginning. As yet the
    Romans had not had time to realise this
    danger; living in an atmosphere of slave-labour,
    they believed that they throve on it.
    And as this was in one sense true, owing to
    the decrease of the free labouring population,
    the evil was too subtle for an uncritical people
    to discern. In spite of all these dangerous
    risings, there is no sign in the copious
    literature of this last century of the Republic
    of any consciousness of the poison at
    work.</p>
<p>Nine years after the murder of Tiberius
    Gracchus, his younger brother Gaius, elected
    tribune, took up his work and went far beyond
    his designs. In this most interesting and
    able man we come at last upon a Roman
    <span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
    statesman of the highest order; a practical
    man, no mere idealist of the new Greek school,
    and yet a man of genius and a born leader of
    men. We possess a picture of him, evidently
    drawn from the life by one who knew him,
    which shows these gifts at a glance.<a class="fn" id="fr_9"
                                           href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_9">[9]</a>
    When
    he was at the height of his activity, busy with
    a multitude of details, he seems to have given
    that eyewitness the impression that he was
    almost a monarch. But a close study of all
    we are told about him seems to prove that
    he was in reality one of those rare men, like
    Cæsar later on, who profoundly believe that
    they can do the work needed by the State
    better than any other man, and who are justified
    in that belief. He would see to the carrying
    out of his own measures with astonishing
    speed, sparing no pains, amazing even his
    enemies by the unflagging energy with which
    he worked, and by the way he contrived to
    get work out of others. Perhaps the secret
    was that he was a gentleman in the best and
    noblest sense of that word; for Plutarch says
    that in his dealings with men he was <i>always</i>
    <span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
    <i>dignified, yet always courteous</i>, invariably giving
    to every man his due.</p>
<p>In fact, the personality of this man is the
    real explanation of his work. If it had been
    possible for him to retain that personal influence
    which Plutarch emphasises, and to keep
    his legislative power even for a few years, as a
    modern statesman may expect to keep it, it
    is quite possible that Rome might have escaped
    an era of danger and degeneracy. But
    that could not be. A triple-headed Cerberus
    was guarding the path that led to effectual
    reform: the forms of the old constitution, out
    of date many of them, and unsuited to the
    needs of a great empire: the narrow spirit of
    the oligarchical faction, opposed, for self-regarding
    reasons, to all change: and lastly,
    the mean and fickle temper of the mongrel city
    populace, whose power was sovereign in legislation
    and elections. In the effort to overcome
    this Cerberus Gracchus lost his precious
    personal influence, and found his original
    designs warped from their true bearing. He
    survived through two tribunates, in the course
    of which he did much valuable work, but in
    the third year he was brutally and needlessly
    slain by his political enemies. Already Rome
    <span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
    had put to death two of the most valuable
    men she ever produced, and in the coming
    century she was to put to death many more.</p>
<p>He had begun his work by a noble effort so
    to mend the constitution that a reformer
    might be able to pass his laws without breaking
    it, as Tiberius had been tempted to do.
    He tried to increase the numbers of the Senate,
    so as to leaven that great council, which
    he rightly looked on as the working centre of
    the constitution, with new ideas and wider
    interests. And he sought, too, to solve the
    great problem of citizenship, by giving the
    Italians some effectual share in it, and so at
    least the chance of making their voice heard
    in Roman politics. But for such measures of
    real progress neither Senate nor people were
    ready: the Senate was the stronghold of old
    prejudices, and the people were not pleased to
    admit Italians to its privileges. Both these
    great projects, which show how far-reaching
    Gracchus’s views as a statesman were, proved
    complete failures.</p>
<p>To conciliate the Senate became more and
    more hopeless as Gracchus lost his personal
    influence, and he gave up the attempt. Instead,
    he dealt the senatorial oligarchy a
    <span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
    heavy blow by depriving senators of the right
    to sit in judgment on ex-provincial governors
    accused of extortion (a crime now becoming
    only too common), and giving it to the class
    below, the Equites, or men of business. Thus
    he made a split between the two upper
    classes of society, which had very unfortunate
    results. Not less unhappy was another
    measure, meant to conciliate the hungry
    free population of the city, on which he must
    depend for the passing of his laws. There
    had long been a difficulty in feeding this
    population: for its number had increased
    beyond all expectation, the corn-supply was
    not properly organised, and the price of grain
    was constantly fluctuating. Recognising the
    fact that any legislator was in peril who could
    not make it impossible that the price should
    rise suddenly, he fixed a permanent price,
    more than half below the normal, to be maintained
    at State cost, whether or no the State
    were a loser. But here he went too far, and
    gave later and less scrupulous demagogues the
    chance of making still more serious mischief.
    No doubt he thought that the State need not
    be a loser, if production, transport, warehousing
    and finance were organised as he
    <span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
    meant to organise them; but there is also
    little doubt that he was mistaken, and that
    henceforward the “people” were really being
    fed largely at the expense of the State, and
    lapsing into a condition of semi-pauperism.</p>
<p>I have said enough to show how sad was the
    failure of the first real statesman produced
    by Rome. Yet Gracchus was able to do some
    useful work which survived. Under his
    auspices was passed a great law, of the text
    of which we still possess about one-third,
    for the trial of provincial governors accused
    of extortion: and we know of another, bearing
    his own name, which regulated the succession
    to these governorships with justice and
    wisdom. Also he took up his brother’s land
    bill, and carried it on with that practical
    persistency which is reflected, as we saw, in
    Plutarch’s life of him. But in spite of high
    aims and some successes, his story is a sad
    one; and the loss to Italy and the Empire
    at that moment of a man of righteous aims
    and practical genius was simply incalculable.</p>
<p>Whatever else the Gracchi did, or failed
    to do, they undoubtedly succeeded, both in
    their lives and in their deaths, in shaking the
    power and prestige of the senatorial government;
    <span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
    and nothing had been put in its place,
    nor had it even been reformed. Henceforward
    for a long period there was no constitution
    that could claim an honest man’s loyalty
    or devotion; the idea of the State was growing
    dim, and the result was inefficiency in every
    department. The governing class was corrupt
    and the army undisciplined, and this at a time
    when there was coming upon Rome, and upon
    the civilised world, a period of extreme peril
    from foreign enemies. This corruption and
    inefficiency became obvious a few years after
    the death of the younger Gracchus in a long
    struggle with a Numidian chief in the province
    of Africa, who contrived to outwit and
    defy Roman envoys and Roman armies, by
    taking advantage of the corruptibility of the
    one and the indiscipline of the other. Luckily
    for Rome this war produced a great soldier in
    Gaius Marius, a “new man” of Italian birth,
    and another in L. Cornelius Sulla, a man of
    high patrician family; and these two, though
    destined to be the bitterest foes, brought the
    war to a successful end.</p>
<p>But a far greater peril was threatening Italy
    herself. As we look at the map of Italy, or
    better still (if we have the chance) as we look
    <span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
    up at the huge rampart of the Alps from
    the plain of the Po, we are tempted to think
    of this great barrier as impenetrable. But
    mountain ranges are always weak lines of
    defence, and history, ancient and modern
    alike, has abundantly proved that Italy is
    open to invasion from the north. Hannibal
    and his brother had pierced the western flank
    of the range, where later on there were regular
    thoroughfares between Rome and her western
    provinces; and at the eastern end, where
    the passes gradually lessen in height, access
    was easy into Italy from the north-east.
    Beyond this mountain barrier, at the time we
    have now reached, there was much disturbance
    going on: hungry masses of population were
    moving about in search of fertile land to settle
    in, themselves pressed on by other peoples in
    the same restless condition. In 113 <span class="small">B.C.</span> a
    great migrating host, apparently of Germans,
    but probably gathering other peoples as it
    advanced, seemed to threaten the weak point
    of the eastern Alps.</p>
<p>A consul with an army was in Illyria, and
    tried to stop them in the country now called
    Carinthia, but was badly beaten. If there
    had been a man of genius at their head, the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
    enemy might have penetrated into Italy; as
    happened again just a century later, there
    was nothing to stop them between the Alps
    and Rome. But the great host was not
    tempted, and pursued its way westward. In
    109 they suddenly appeared beyond the western
    Alps, where they destroyed another consular
    army, and yet another fell before the Gauls
    of that region. Then in 105, at Orange, in
    Roman territory, while trying to cover the
    road to Massilia and so into Italy, the Romans
    experienced a defeat almost as terrible as that
    of Cannæ and half the Empire lay open to
    the victors. But once again they left their
    prey untouched, and passed westwards in
    search of easier conquests.</p>
<p>Rome had a breathing-time of nearly three
    years, and she also had the right man to
    save her. Marius remodelled the army,
    revolutionising it in equipment, tactics, and
    discipline. For material he was driven hard,
    and had to find recruits as best he could,
    drawing them from all parts of the Empire:
    but he had time to drill them into fine soldiers,
    and to lay the foundation of a marvellously
    perfect human defence for Mediterranean
    civilisation. The result was one great victory
    <span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
    near Marseilles, and another at the eastern
    end of north Italy, into which the barbarians
    had at last penetrated: and Italy was once
    more secure.</p>
<p>Now we have to see how this peril, or rather
    the effort made to escape it, led to changes of
    the most far-reaching character in the Roman
    power and polity. Italy had not been saved
    by Roman armies or the Roman government,
    but by Marius and the army which he had
    created. For five successive years Marius
    was consul, contrary to all precedent, away
    from Rome; and the army he created looked
    to him, not to Rome, for pay, promotion, and
    discharge. We may call that host of his a
    Mediterranean army under the command of
    an Italian. It was far more like Hannibal’s
    army than like the old Roman citizen armies
    that had won the supremacy in Italy; it was
    a professional army devoted to its general,
    but with little thought of the Roman State
    whose servant he was. And henceforward,
    until Augustus restored the sense of duty to
    the State, the Roman armies, excellent now
    as fighting machines, and destined to secure
    effective frontiers for the Empire, were the
    men of Marius, Sulla, Pompey, Cæsar, and a
    <span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
    constant source of anxiety and danger for
    the State whom they were supposed to
    serve.</p>
<p>This “long-service army” brought Rome
    face to face with another difficulty, and led
    indirectly to another great peril. When the
    soldiers returned home after many years of
    service in distant regions, what was to be done
    with them? Many, perhaps most of them,
    had no homes to go to. The veterans might
    naturally demand some permanent settlement,
    but the Senate showed no sign of appreciating
    the problem, and in this matter the
    general was helpless without the Senate. So it
    happened that many of them lapsed into the
    crowded city, to pick up a living we know not
    how, with the help of the distribution of cheap
    corn. Among them were beyond doubt
    numbers of non-citizens, who could not legally
    vote in elections or legislation, and were
    inadequately protected in regard to person
    and property, in spite of all the long service
    they had gone through. These men began to
    offer themselves as voters, and to exercise the
    rights of citizenship illegally; yet the confusion
    of the registers was such that they could
    not be detected. At last the adulteration of
    <span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
    the Roman citizen body became so obvious
    that the consuls of 95 <span class="small">B.C.</span> passed a law with
    the object of making it clear who was a citizen
    and who was not, and of eliminating those
    who were not really privileged.</p>
<p>But it was now too late to take such a step.
    News of it spread over all Italy, and it was
    construed as a deliberate attempt to exclude
    Italians from the citizenship. Five years later
    another vain attempt was made by a noble
    tribune to do as Gracchus had wished to do,
    to extend the citizenship and to enlarge the
    Senate: but he was assassinated before his
    laws were passed, and then at last there followed
    the inevitable outbreak, perhaps long
    meditated. The social war, as it is called, in
    reality a civil war, was a crisis in the history
    of European development. When it was over,
    the ancient city-state of the Greeks and
    Italians had vanished in Italy, and in its place
    arose a new form of polity, for which there
    was then no name.</p>
<p>The sturdy peoples of central Italy entered
    on the desperate venture of setting up a rival
    power against Rome; a plan which, if successful,
    would have paralysed Rome’s work
    in the world whether for good or evil. They
    <span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
    chose the city of Corfinium, in the heart of
    the Apennines, some hundred miles east of
    Rome, gave it the new significant name
    Italica, and made it, as Washington is now,
    the city-centre of a federation, where deputies
    from the various members should meet and
    deliberate under the presidency of consuls.
    But now was seen the value of the strategical
    position of Rome. She could strike in any
    direction from inner lines, while safe from
    attack or blockade by sea; but Corfinium had
    no such natural strategic advantage, nor any
    unifying power. Yet the Italians were for
    some time successful in the field, and Rome
    was for a whole year in the utmost peril.
    At the end of that year (90 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) the Etruscans
    and Umbrians to north and east joined the
    confederates, and then for the first time Rome
    was likely to be put on the defensive, with
    enemies on her left flank, as well as on her
    right and in front. So a law was hastily passed
    giving the precious citizenship to all who had
    not taken up arms; and this was the beginning
    of a process by which, in some few years,
    the whole of Italy became Roman in the eye
    of the law, while, on the other hand, it might
    be said not untruly that Rome became
    <span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
    Italian. Henceforward we have to think of
    the whole peninsula as forming the material
    support of Mediterranean civilisation.</p>
<p>With this great change one might have
    expected that peace and harmony would
    return to Italy. But, on the contrary, she is
    now about to enter on the most terrible time
    that she has ever known; even her miserable
    feuds of the late Middle Ages never quite
    reached the horror of those of Marius and
    Sulla. It is hard to explain this; but looking
    back at what was said in the last chapter about
    the causes of demoralisation, it is possible to
    make a guess. We have to think of a vast
    slave State, worn out in the struggle with
    dangers within and without, enfeebled by
    constant warfare, and now given over into the
    hands of powerful military masters, with hosts
    of veterans at their beck and call. The State
    seemed to have lost its claim to loyalty, even
    to consideration: and in its place were rival
    generals, leaders also of political factions—in
    these years two, Marius the self-seeking
    champion of the Italians and the Roman
    plebs, and Sulla the self-seeking champion of
    the old aristocracy. All principles were lost
    on either side in the intensely bitter hatred of
    <span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
    the parties and the personal rivalry of the
    leading men. It happened that a war
    was threatening in the East, of which
    we shall hear more in the next chapter;
    and the command in this war, the great
    prize of the moment, became a bone of
    contention outweighing all interest of the
    State.</p>
<p>The prize fell to Sulla; but no sooner was
    his back turned on Italy than the Marian
    faction fell on their political enemies and
    sought to destroy them by wholesale murder.
    Compromise was utterly forgotten; all the
    brutality of unbridled human nature was let
    loose. And when Sulla returned from the
    East, after driving the enemy out of Roman
    territory, the massacres were revenged by
    more massacres. The loss to Italy of many
    thousands of her best men, and among them
    scores who might have done good work in
    the world, was a calamity never to be repaired.</p>
<p>Where, one may ask, was the old Roman
    <i>gravitas</i> and <i>pietas</i>, the self-restraint and sense
    of duty that had won an empire? It would
    seem as if the capacity for discipline were
    entirely lost, except in the long-service army.
    <span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
    But the mere fact that in the army this survived
    is one not to be neglected, even if it
    were exercised less on behalf of the State than
    in the interest of the individual commander.
    For if there could be found a statesman-soldier
    who could identify himself with the true interest
    of the State, and so bring back not only
    the army, but the people to a right idea of
    Rome’s position and duty in the world, the
    Empire and civilisation might yet be saved.
    Without the army these could not be defended;
    and the one thing wanting was to
    make the army loyal to the State as well as
    to its general. Only the general himself could
    secure this loyalty, by making himself the true
    servant of the State.</p>
<p>But the man into whose hands Rome had
    now fallen was one who could not possibly
    identify himself with the best interests of the
    State, because an unsympathetic nature had
    denied him the power of discerning what those
    interests were. Sulla has been compared to
    Napoleon, and in one or two points the comparison
    holds good; but the two were utterly
    unlike in the main point, the power of sympathetic
    discernment. Napoleon, cruel and unscrupulous
    as he often was, showed plainly,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
    when he organised the institutions of France,
    or Switzerland, or Egypt, that he understood
    the needs of those nations: he divined what
    would enable them to advance out of stagnation
    to some better form of life, social and
    political. But Sulla, though he saw that the
    call of the moment was for order at almost
    any price, for peace, strong government,
    and reform, went about his work in a way
    which proved that he did not delight in it,
    or care for the people for whom he was legislating.
    He did what was necessary for the
    moment, but did it with force ill concealed
    under constitutional forms. So no wise man
    rejoiced in his work, and the Roman people
    as a whole felt no loyalty towards him. He
    provided in many State departments an
    excellent machinery, but not the motive force
    to work it.</p>
<p>Nothing in history shows better how much
    in remedial legislation depends on the spirit
    in which it is undertaken. Sulla saw that the
    great council, the Senate, must be the central
    point and pivot of government, unless indeed
    there were a master at hand, like himself, to
    undertake it; that the popular assemblies,
    untrained in discussion and affairs, could not
    <span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
    do the work of administration. Though the
    theory of the constitution had always been
    that the people were sovereign, he contrived
    that the Senate, which had so long practically
    governed under an unwritten constitution,
    should now rule without let or hindrance on
    a basis of statute law; and here we see an
    unwritten constitution growing into a written
    one, as with us Britons at this moment.
    By a great law of treason, the first on the
    Roman statute book, he made it almost
    impossible to defy the Senate without the
    risk of political effacement.</p>
<p>This may be called reactionary, but under
    the circumstances it was not a reaction to
    be complained of. The pity was that this
    master legislator had really none to be grateful
    or loyal to him but his own army and followers.
    His constitutional legislation was for
    the most part swept away soon after his
    death, and there was no one to lament. On
    the other hand, all that he did that was not
    strictly political, and in particular his reorganisation
    of what we may call the civil service,
    and of the criminal law and procedure,
    was so obviously progressive and valuable
    that no one ever attempted to destroy it; and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
    some of his laws of this kind held good
    throughout Roman history.</p>
<p>Sulla attained his power in 81 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, resigned
    it in 79, and died next year at his villa on the
    warm Campanian coast, where he had gone
    to enjoy himself in self-indulgence and literary
    dilettantism. Here he wrote that autobiography
    of which some few fragments have
    come down to us in Plutarch’s <i>Life</i> of him—a
    life which will repay the reader, even in
    translation. One of these fragments has
    always seemed to me to throw real light on
    the man’s strange nature, and on the imperfection
    of his work. “All my most happy
    resolutions,” he wrote, “have been the result,
    not of reasoning, but of momentary inspiration.”
    In other words, Sulla did not believe
    in thinking over a problem, and herein he was
    a true Roman. He hoped to do the right
    thing on the spur of the moment. Thus it was
    that no one ever knew what he would do; no
    one could trust him nor believe in him. Like
    so many in that and succeeding ages he believed
    profoundly in Fortune: he called himself
    Sulla the Fortunate, and gave like names
    to his two children. What exactly he meant
    by Fortuna we cannot say; but we may be
    <span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
    sure that it was no such conception of a
    power ruling the world as might guide a
    statesman’s feet out of the path of self-seeking
    into a more bracing region of high
    endeavour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
    <br><span class="h2line2">THE REVOLUTION: ACT II</span></h2>
<p>With the death of Sulla ends what we may
    call the first act of the Roman Revolution.
    We are now in the middle of a revolution in
    more than one sense of that word. The constitution
    and the government of Rome are
    being slowly but surely changed, and at the
    same time the era of the free and independent
    city-state of the Græco-Roman world is
    being brought to an end. Both these changes,
    as we can see now, were inevitable; without
    them the civilised world could not have
    been defended against barbarian invasion, or
    Italy united into a contented whole possessed
    of Roman citizenship. In the first act, as I
    have called it, the immediate danger of invasion
    was checked, both in north and east,
    and Italy had become Roman, enjoying perfect
    equality with Rome under the great body
    of Roman law now being rapidly developed.</p>
<p>But, in truth, this inevitable work of change
    <span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
    was not as yet half done. It was soon found
    that both in north and east some definite
    system of frontier must be fixed, or the Empire
    would be in continual peril from without.
    It was also found that Sulla’s constitution
    would not work, and that to defend the
    frontiers of civilisation effectively there must
    be a government of sterner force, whatever
    form that force might take. Thus in the
    second act of the Revolution we have two
    main points to attend to: first, the settlement
    of the frontiers against Oriental despots
    and wandering hordes of Germans: secondly,
    the acquisition of power by a great soldier-statesman,
    Julius Cæsar, and the abandonment,
    as a working power, of the ancient
    polity of Senate and people. And inasmuch
    as this period of revolution was also the age
    of the best and purest bloom of Latin literature,
    I must find space for a few words about
    Cicero, Lucretius, and Catullus.</p>
<p>I said in the last chapter that there was a
    very dangerous enemy threatening the eastern
    or Greek part of the Empire. This was
    Mithradates, king of Pontus, that part of
    Asia Minor which borders on the Euxine
    (Black Sea) eastwards: a man of genius and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
    ambition, and by no means to be reckoned a
    barbarian. It is curious that he began his
    great career by protecting Greek cities against
    their enemies, and one is tempted to ask
    whether he might not have been at least as
    beneficent a champion and master for the
    Greek world as Rome herself. But we must
    look at things with Roman eyes if we are to
    understand the work of Rome in the world;
    we must think of Mithradates as the Romans
    then did, as the deadly enemy alike of Greek
    freedom and of Roman interests.</p>
<p>His armies had invaded Greece in 87 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
    and had even occupied Athens, while the
    Greek cities of Asia Minor had willingly submitted
    to him: the whole Hellenic world
    was fast coming under his sway. Then Sulla
    had expelled his generals from Greece proper,
    and had forced him to accept such conditions
    of peace as kept him quiet for a few years.
    But when Sulla was dead he started on a
    fresh career of conquest, and once more the
    Roman protectorate of Greek civilisation
    was broken down. For a time it looked as
    if no power could restore it. The sea was
    swarming with pirates from Cilicia, who
    constantly harassed the Roman fleets, and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
    ventured even as far as Italy, snapping up
    prisoners for sale as slaves in the great slave-market
    at Delos. And behind Mithradates
    and these pirates there was another power
    even more formidable. Tigranes, king of
    Armenia, had also been extending his dominions
    southward, and was even in possession
    of Syria and Judæa at the time of which
    we are now speaking, 75 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Should the two
    kings unite their forces and policy, it would
    be all but impossible for Rome to remain
    the mistress of the eastern Mediterranean and
    the Hellenic world. It was another example
    of Rome’s wonderful good fortune that this
    alliance was never solidly effected till too
    late.</p>
<p>The Senate, left by Sulla to govern the
    world, soon showed that it was incapable of
    grasping the necessity of vigorous action in
    the East. It was not till 74, four years after
    Sulla’s death, that they sent out a really
    capable general with an adequate force.
    Lucullus, whose name has become a by-word
    for wealth and luxury, was in his prime a
    soldier of great ability, and he soon broke
    the power of Mithradates, who immediately
    fled for refuge to Tigranes. This made it
    <span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
    absolutely necessary to deal with that king
    also; and Lucullus invaded Armenia and
    captured the king’s new capital, Tigranocerta.
    Unluckily, he had not that supreme
    gift of a great commander which enables
    him, as it afterwards enabled Cæsar, to
    lead his men where and when he will; the
    army mutinied, refusing to go farther into
    the wild Armenian mountains, the most
    distant and formidable region a Roman army
    had as yet penetrated. Lucullus had to
    retreat.</p>
<p>Then, under pressure from the men of
    business who were losing money by the
    instability of Roman dominion in Asia,
    Senate and people agreed to supersede
    Lucullus by a younger man, reckoned the
    best soldier of the day, and a military pupil
    of Sulla. This was the famous Gnæus
    Pompeius, known to us familiarly as Pompey.
    In 67 he had been commissioned to clear the
    sea of pirates, and did it effectually. Now,
    with a combination of civil and military
    power such as no Roman had yet enjoyed,
    he took over Lucullus’s army, made short
    work of Mithradates, and utterly broke up
    the empire of Tigranes. He overran Syria,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
    the region between the Mediterranean and the
    desert stretching to the Euphrates, penetrated
    to Judæa and took Jerusalem. This
    famous event is the first in the long and sad
    story of the relations of Rome with Judæa.
    At Jericho, before he reached the holy city,
    he received the dispatch which told him of
    the death of Mithradates, the removal from
    the scene of one who had been for thirty
    years Rome’s most dangerous enemy.</p>
<p>The result of the efforts of Lucullus and
    Pompey was the establishment of a frontier
    system in the East which may be said to have
    held good for the rest of Roman history.
    The principle of it is not easy to explain;
    but if the reader will take a map and trace
    the river Euphrates from its sources in western
    Armenia to the Arabian desert, and then
    make it clear to himself that all within that
    line was to be either Roman or under Roman
    suzerainty, he will be able to form some idea
    of its importance in history. There were
    to be three new Roman provinces: Pontus
    with Bithynia in the north of Asia Minor,
    Cilicia on its south-eastern coast, and Syria,
    the coast region from Cilicia southwards to
    the frontier of Egypt. But between these
    <span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
    and the Euphrates there were two kingdoms,
    Cappadocia and Galatia, and other smaller
    ones, which formed <i>a Roman sphere of influence</i>
    where Rome herself could not as yet be
    constantly present. Imperfect as this system
    seems, it was quite strong enough to
    spread the prestige of the Roman Empire far
    and wide in the East, and the great king of
    Parthia, beyond the Euphrates, might well
    begin to be alarmed for his own safety.</p>
<p>Now in settling this frontier system Pompey
    had, of course, to attend to an infinite
    number of details, and to make decisions,
    convey privileges, negotiate treaties, and
    grant charters, in dealing with those cities
    new and old which formed a most important
    part of his plan of settlement and defence.
    All this had to be done on his own responsibility,
    but would need the sanction of the
    Senate to be recognised as legally valid.
    When he returned home in 62 <span class="small">B.C.</span> he expected
    that the Senate would give this sanction,
    especially as he had just disbanded his
    army, with which he might, if he had chosen,
    have enforced his claims. But the Senatorial
    government was reduced to such a state of
    imbecility that the majority would have
    <span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
    nothing to do with Pompey’s invaluable
    work: they were jealous, they were lazy, and,
    above all, they were ignorant. So he had to
    fall back after a year or two on the consul
    of 59, C. Julius Cæsar, who undertook to get
    the necessary sanction from the people if
    not from the Senate. In return Pompey was
    to help him to get a long command in Gaul,
    so that the work of frontier defence there
    begun by Marius might be resumed and
    completed. At this very moment a German
    people, the Suebi, whose name still survives
    in the modern Swabia, were threatening the
    rich plains of what is now eastern France:
    and then, just as a peace had been patched
    up with them, a Gallic tribe, the Helvetii,
    suddenly issuing from its home in (modern)
    Switzerland in search of new settlements, or
    pressed on by other tribes beyond it, was
    about to break into the Roman province of
    Transalpine Gaul. But Cæsar had now done
    his part by Pompey, though not, indeed, without
    straining the constitution; and moving
    with the wonderful swiftness that afterwards
    became characteristic of him as a general,
    he reached Geneva just in time to stop
    them, and soon afterwards beat them in a
    <span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
    great battle and forced them back to their
    homes.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of a career of conquest
    which made the glorious country we
    know as France into the most valuable part
    of the Roman Empire, and later on into
    the most compact and gifted nationality in
    Europe. What motives inspired Cæsar in all
    he did during the nine years he spent there
    we need not ask, for we can only guess the
    answer; though he has left us his own story
    of his campaigns in simple straightforward
    Latin, he has not chosen to tell us what was
    all along at the back of his mind. Ambition,
    says the superficial historian; the desire to
    make himself in due time tyrant of Rome
    and the Empire. But we may take it as certain
    that Cæsar, a man whose health was
    never strong, would not have exposed himself
    to constant peril of his life for nine successive
    years had he really all the time been
    nursing a secret ambition which death or
    serious illness might at any time destroy.
    What he really seems to have loved, like
    C. Gracchus, was work—steady, hard work
    with no one to hinder him, and with a definite
    practical object before him. Doubtless further
    <span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
    hopes or fears were in his mind, but this
    great practical genius, with an intellect characteristically
    Roman,<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_10">[10]</a>
    though more scientific
    in its tendency than that of any other
    Roman known to us, was always bent on the
    work immediately in front of him, and never
    rested till it was completed to his satisfaction.</p>
<p>When Cæsar hurried up to check the Helvetii
    in 58 <span class="small">B.C.</span> there was but one Roman
    province in Gaul, the south-eastern part of
    modern France (which still teems with Roman
    remains and inscriptions), together with a
    considerable district to the west of it at the
    foot of the Pyrenees. When he finally left
    Gaul at the end of 50, the whole of modern
    France and Belgium had been added to the
    Empire, though not as yet organised into
    provinces. He did not take long to reach
    our Channel and to subdue the tribes on the
    coast; he began the written history of our
    island by invading it twice, and recording
    such information as he could gain about its
    geography and inhabitants. He crossed the
    Rhine into Germany by a bridge constructed
    for him by his engineers: and the method of
    building this bridge survives in his book to
    <span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
    puzzle the ingenuity of scholars as well as
    school-boys. The Gauls were doubtless
    amazed at these performances, as he meant
    them to be; and, after one heroic effort to
    save themselves from becoming an appendage
    of a Mediterranean empire, they had to
    submit. While we can feel with these noble
    efforts for freedom, or blame Cæsar for what
    sometimes seems unnecessary cruelty, we
    must remember that from this time forward
    the country from the Rhine to the ocean becomes
    a great factor in European civilisation.</p>
<p>There was still, indeed, a gap in the line of
    frontier; how was the eastern end of the Alps
    to be protected from invasion? There, as
    we saw, the great rampart was lowest, and
    beyond it the barbarians were an unknown
    quantity. Here the river Danube eventually
    became the frontier, and was carefully connected
    with that of the Rhine; but this
    completion of the great work had to wait for
    half-a-century, and in the meantime luckily
    no inroad was made or threatened. It was
    Tiberius, afterwards emperor, another great
    soldier, with an army almost as devoted to its
    general as that of Cæsar who after long
    steady effort planted the Roman power
    <span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
    firmly in this region. From a military point
    of view the Roman Empire, and therefore
    Western civilisation as a whole, owed its
    very existence for centuries to Pompey,
    Cæsar and Tiberius, with their splendidly
    trained armies and their skilful engineers.</p>
<p>All this work of conquest and settlement
    was not the work of the State, or due to the
    old civic sense of duty and discipline; it was
    the work of the armies, due to their good
    discipline, and to their loyalty to their leaders.
    This being so, it was of course only natural
    that the armies and their leaders should
    claim to control the action and policy of an
    enfeebled State, as Sulla had already claimed
    it. This is really, put in a very few words,
    the secret of the Roman imperial system that
    was to come; so, too, in England, in Cromwell’s
    time, the State passed into the hands
    of the army, because that army (though in
    our case but for a short time) represented the
    best instincts and purposes of the nation.
    But the question of the moment was whether
    the commander of one of these Roman
    armies could so identify himself and his
    soldiers with the State and its true interests,
    as to become the means of establishing
    <span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
    a sound and efficient government for the
    Mediterranean world. Sulla had failed so
    to identify himself: he had neither knowledge
    enough nor sympathy enough. The
    chance had been open to Pompey when he
    returned from the East in 62, but he had disbanded
    his army and declined it; he was in
    many ways a valuable man, but he was not
    the stuff that real statesmen are made of.
    After the long war in Gaul the chance was
    open to Cæsar, and he accepted it without
    hesitation.</p>
<p>He accepted it, but in truth he had to
    fight for it. For years his operations in
    Gaul had been looked on at Rome with suspicion,
    especially by a clique of personal
    enemies led by the famous Cato, a descendant
    of the old Cato whom we met in the previous
    century. These men looked on Cæsar as dangerous
    to the State—and dangerous indeed
    he was, to that old form of State which neither
    they nor he could make vigorous and efficient.
    They clung to the worn-out machinery of
    the constitution, to the checks, the vetoes,
    the short tenure of office, to the exclusive
    right of the Senate to deal with the ever-increasing
    administrative business of the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
    Empire. Knowing, or guessing, that Cæsar,
    like Gaius Gracchus, would force his personal
    will on the State if he judged it necessary,
    they were determined to prevent his becoming
    a political power, and they brought Pompey
    to the same view, and armed him with military
    force to be used against Cæsar—against
    the man, that is, who had spent the best years
    of his life in indefatigable work for the Empire
    and civilisation. The result was civil war
    once more; civil war that might unquestionably
    have been averted by a wider outlook,
    a more generous feeling, a spirit of compromise,
    on the part of the high aristocrats
    who, like Cato, believed themselves to be
    struggling for liberty. The liberty they were
    struggling for was in reality the liberty to
    misgovern the Empire, and to talk without
    acting efficiently.</p>
<p>It is plain, as we may learn from the abundant
    correspondence of the time,<a class="fn" id="fr_11"
                                  href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_11">[11]</a> that
    they
    did not know the man they had to deal with.
    Cæsar took them completely by surprise;
    in a few weeks he had cleared Pompey and
    Senate and their army out of Italy, had provided
    for the government, and gone off to
    <span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
    Spain to secure the West by turning the
    Pompeian armies out of that peninsula also.
    After a brilliant campaign of six weeks,
    admirably described by himself in his work
    on the Civil War, he forced those armies to
    surrender and then let them go, as he had done
    just before in Italy. His clemency took the
    world by surprise as much as his generalship.</p>
<p>But the worst was not over for him. Pompey
    was gathering all the resources of the
    East against him, and concentrating them
    in Epirus with a view to the re-conquest of
    Italy. Again Cæsar’s rapidity saved him;
    he was just in time to strike the first blow
    by crossing the sea from Brindisi—a rash expedient—and
    hampering Pompey before his
    concentration was effected. Here, however,
    in his eagerness to bring the campaign to an
    issue, he made a serious blunder, and had to
    pay for it by defeat and a retreat to the corn-growing
    plain of Thessaly. Pompey unwisely
    followed him, instead of invading Italy; and
    here, in August 48, was utterly beaten at the
    battle of Pharsalia. The worn-out old soldier
    fled to Egypt, where he was treacherously
    murdered by one of the king’s generals. He
    was an estimable man with many excellent
    <span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
    qualities, and in a more tranquil age might
    have well become what Cicero wished to make
    him, the presiding genius of the Roman State.</p>
<p>Cæsar had yet much war before him—war
    in Egypt, in Asia Minor, in Africa and in
    Spain, against the supporters of the old
    régime, for nothing he could do in the way of
    conciliation would persuade them to forgive
    him the crime of seeking to identify himself
    with the State. In doing so they deprived
    him of the time which he might have spent
    to far better purpose at Rome on the work
    of efficient government. As it was, he had
    been able to spend but a few months in all
    at home, when on March 15, 44 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, he was
    murdered at a meeting of the Senate, at the
    feet of Pompey’s statue, by a small group
    of assassins, some of whom were intimate
    friends of his own. They thought he was on
    the point of assuming a visible despotism,
    and they had some justification for the suspicion,
    though it was probably a delusion.
    To kill a tyrant, they thought, was to do a
    noble work in true old Roman fashion. So
    did the murderers of the Gracchi.</p>
<p>From what little we know about such work
    of reform as Cæsar had time for, we may take
    <span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
    it as certain that these deluded assassins
    made a sad blunder. Cæsar’s legislative
    work was fragmentary, but every item of it
    shows intelligence and political insight. He
    did not attempt to turn out a new constitution
    in black and white; he did the work of
    government mainly himself for the time
    being, and we do not know how he meant to
    provide for it after his death. In the most
    important matter of all, the adjustment of
    the Empire to the home government, and
    especially the subordination of the provincial
    governors to a central authority, he forestalled
    the imperial system of the future: he
    made himself the central authority, to whom
    the governors were to be responsible. The
    other most important question of government,
    that of the power and composition of
    the Senate, he answered by raising the number
    of Senators to 900, as Gaius Gracchus
    had wished to do, and thus destroying the
    power of the old narrow oligarchical cliques.
    But perhaps his practical wisdom is best seen
    in his economic legislation for Rome and
    Italy. He was the first statesman to try and
    check the over-abundance of slave-labour;
    the first, too, to lay the foundation of a
    <span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
    reasonable bankruptcy law. He regulated
    the corn-supply in the city, and brought down
    the number of recipients of corn-doles to less
    than one-half of what it had lately been.
    Again, he laid down general rules for the
    qualification of candidates for municipal
    office in Italy, and arranged for the taking of
    a census in all the cities every five years, the
    records of which were to be deposited at
    Rome. It would seem as if he meant to work
    out the enfranchisement of Italy to its
    natural conclusion: for he not only completed
    it by extending it to the Alps, which
    had never yet been done, but went beyond
    the bounds of Italy, offering the citizenship
    freely both to Gauls and Sicilians.</p>
<p>Attempts have been made to depict Cæsar
    as almost more than human; and of late
    again there has been a reaction against him
    of no less absurdity, holding him up to contempt
    as a weak but lucky opportunist.
    As we have his own military writings, a life
    by Plutarch, a few letters written by or
    addressed to him, and innumerable allusions
    to him in contemporary literature, we ought
    to be able to form some just idea of him. As
    one who has been familiar with all these
    <span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
    materials, and many others of less value,
    during the greater part of a lifetime, I say
    without hesitation that Cæsar was the one
    man of his time really gifted with <i>scientific
        intelligence</i>—with the power of seeing the facts
    before him and adjusting his action to them.
    This intelligence, combined with great
    strength of will, made him master of the
    Roman Empire; and though his character
    was by no means perfect, he seems to have
    used his mastership, not like a capricious
    Oriental despot, but with a real sense of
    responsibility. A man who combines the
    qualities of an intelligent statesman in bad
    times with a generous temper, good taste
    and good scholarship, surely deserves to be
    thought of as one altogether out of the
    common. In Shakespeare’s picture of him,
    derived from Plutarch’s biography, and representing
    only the last two days of his life,
    he seems weak in body and overweening in
    spirit, and is probably meant to seem so by
    the dramatist for his own purposes. But
    no sooner have the murderers done with him
    than the true greatness of the man begins
    to make itself felt, and is impressed on us
    in page after page to the end of the play, of
    <span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
    which the action may be said to be pivoted
    on the idea of the horror and the uselessness
    of their deed.</p>
<p class="tb">So far in this chapter and the last I have
    been treating of this age as one of action.
    It is indeed filled full of human activity, in
    spite of the laziness of the governing class as
    a whole. But this activity was shown not
    only in war and politics; this is also an age
    of great poets and real men of letters. I
    must say a word about the two greatest
    poets, Lucretius and Catullus; but among the
    men of letters there stands out one far above
    the rest whose life and genius it would take
    a long chapter to explain. Cicero’s pre-eminence
    is not easy to understand even after
    long study of his voluminous works: yet I
    must try to make it clear that he was, in
    fact, one of the greatest of all Romans.</p>
<p>Of Lucretius it is our fate to know nothing
    except his poem in six books on “The Nature
    of Things.” But his name is Roman, and
    the poem has the true Roman characteristic
    of being essentially practical in its object.
    That object will seem a singular one to those
    who are unacquainted with the Greek and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
    Roman culture of this age. What roused
    a poet’s passion in this man’s mind was simply
    the desire to free others, as he had freed himself,
    from the fetters of superstition, or, as
    he calls it, <i>religion</i>; to make them abandon
    the delusive dream of a life after death, to
    repudiate the old stories of torment in Hades,
    and all foolish legends of the gods, who in
    his view took no interest whatever in human
    life. All this was, of course, derived from
    Greek philosophy, the doctrine of the Epicurean
    school, but no Greek had ever put
    such passion into a creed as Lucretius. His
    poetry at times almost reminds us of the
    grandeur and authority of the Hebrew prophets,
    so ardently did he believe in his own
    creed, and in his mission to enforce it on
    others. Uncouth and dry as much of it is—for
    he has to explain that Epicurean theory
    of the universe known still to science as the
    atomic theory—he breaks out now and again
    into strains of magnificent verse which reveal
    a mind all burning within. Here is a specimen:
    it must be in prose, for no verse translation
    seems adequate—</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>“What hast thou, O mortal, so much at
        <span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
        heart, that thou goest such lengths in sickly
        sorrows? Why bemoan and bewail death?
        for say that thy life past and gone has been
        welcome to thee, and that thy blessings have
        not all, as if they were poured into a sieve,
        run through and been lost without avail:
        why not then take thy departure like a guest
        filled with life, and with resignation, thou
        fool, enter upon untroubled rest? But if all
        that thou hast enjoyed has been squandered
        and lost, and if life is a grievance, why seek
        to make any addition, ... why not rather
        make an end of life and travail? for there
        is nothing which I can contrive or discover
        for thee to give pleasure: all things are ever
        the same” (iii. 933 foll.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other poet, Catullus, was not of Roman
    birth, but, like so many literary men of this
    and the following age, an Italian from the
    basin of the Po. He had no practical aim
    in writing poetry: he simply wrote because
    he could not help it, about himself and his
    friends and his loves. It was his own self
    that inspired him chiefly, and it is still himself
    that interests us. According to his own
    mood, now fresh with the happiness of an
    <span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
    artist, now darkened by anger or self-indulgence,
    his poems are exquisite or repulsive;
    but they are always true and honest lyrics,
    and interesting because they are so full of
    life and passion. Catullus is one of the
    world’s best lyric poets. Here is one of his
    gems—</p>
<div class="verse">
    <p class="t0">“Is aught of pleasure, aught of solace sweet</p>
    <p class="t">Permitted, Calvus, to the silent grave,</p>
    <p class="t0">What time the tale of sorrow we repeat,</p>
    <p class="t">Yearning o’er memories we fain would save?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
    <p class="t0">Know this. From Love and Friendship if a tear</p>
    <p class="t">Can make its way into that silentness,</p>
    <p class="t0">Quintilia feels untimely Death less drear,</p>
    <p class="t">For hearing of the love that still can bless.”</p>
    <p class="lr">Catullus, xcvi. (by S. T. I).</p>
</div>
<p>Lastly, we come to the man of letters who
    has given his name to this period of literature,
    which indeed draws more than half its interest
    from him and from his works. Marcus
    Tullius Cicero was an Italian, and had little
    <span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
    of the Roman character in his make; he
    came from the town of Arpinum, among the
    foothills of the Apennines some sixty miles
    south-east of Rome. He made his way into
    Roman society by his social and conversational
    powers, and by his capacity for friendship,
    and into the field of politics by his great
    gift of oratory, which was now indispensable
    for public men. As a “new man” he never
    was really at home with the high aristocracy,
    but he was a man of many friends for all
    that, and reckoned among them all the great
    men of his time, including both Cæsar and
    Pompey. His best and truest friend, who
    worked for him all his life with unsparing
    care, was a man of business who stood outside
    of politics, Pomponius Atticus; and of
    Cicero’s letters to this faithful friend and
    adviser nearly four hundred survive to prove
    the reality of that lifelong devotion. Some
    five hundred letters to and from other correspondents
    are also extant, and the whole
    collection forms the most fascinating record
    of a great man’s life and thoughts that has
    come down to us from classical antiquity.</p>
<p>Since Mommsen wrote his famous <i>History
    of Rome</i>, in which he was almost ignored,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
    Cicero has often been treated with contempt
    as a shallow thinker, deriving all his inspiration
    from Greek originals, and as a feeble
    statesman, brilliant only as an orator. It
    is true that there is a want of <i>grit</i> in much
    that Cicero wrote: he was the child of his age,
    never tired of writing and talking, little used
    to profound thinking, and rarely acting with
    independent vigour. But he has two claims
    on the gratitude of posterity which should
    never be forgotten. First, he made Latin
    into the most perfect language of prose that
    the world as yet has known. The echoes of
    his beautiful style can be heard centuries
    afterwards in the Latin fathers of Christianity,
    especially St. Augustine and Lactantius,
    and they are still audible in the best French
    and Italian prose-writers of to-day. Secondly,
    of all Romans Cicero is the one best
    known to us as an individual human being:
    and few indeed who have had the chance to
    become really familiar with him can fail to
    love him as his own friends loved him. He
    was not the stuff of which strong statesmen
    are made; he was too dependent on the support
    and approval of others to inspire men
    with zeal for a cause—especially for a losing
    <span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
    cause. His own consulship was brilliant, for
    he was able to combine the best elements in
    the State in the cause of order as against
    anarchy—anarchy which threatened the very
    existence of Rome as a city; and at the end
    of his life he showed the same ability to use
    a strong combination to good purpose in the
    political field. But he was not of such strong
    growth as to mark out a line of his own, and
    at some unhappy moments of his life his
    weakness is apt to move our pity, if not our
    contempt.</p>
<p>But with all his weak points Cicero is one
    of the best and greatest of all Romans. His
    gifts were rich, and he used them well. We
    know him as a man of pure life in an impure
    age, and as one who never used his gifts or
    opportunities to do harm to others, whether
    political enemies or helpless provincials. We
    know him, too, as a faithful husband and a
    devoted father. And lastly, we know that
    he was not lacking in courage when the assassin
    overtook him—the last of a long list of
    great men of that age to die a violent death.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
    <br><span class="h2line2">AUGUSTUS—THE REVIVAL OF THE ROMAN SPIRIT</span></h2>
<p>The death of Julius Cæsar seemed to
    plunge the world once more into darkness.
    We have evidence enough of the general feeling
    of horror and despair,—a despair hard to
    realise in our days, when settled and orderly
    government saves us from all serious anxiety
    about our lives and property. Power fell into
    the hands of a far more unscrupulous man
    than Cæsar, the Mark Antony of Shakespeare’s
    play; but he had a rival in Cæsar’s
    nephew and adopted son, afterwards known
    as Augustus. Civil war, of course, followed:
    first, war between these two and the murderers
    of Julius, and then war between the
    two victors. Antony, who had in a division
    of the Empire taken the eastern half, and
    married Cleopatra, the beautiful queen of
    Egypt, was crushed at the naval battle of
    Actium: the Empire became once more
    <span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
    united, and hope began to spring up
    afresh.</p>
<p>Instead of following the melancholy history
    of these years (44 to 31 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) let us try to
    realise the need of a complete change in men’s
    minds and in the ways of government, if the
    Roman Empire was to be preserved, and
    Mediterranean civilisation with it. We can
    best do this by learning something of the two
    men who more than all others brought about
    the change: Virgil, the greatest of Roman
    poets, and Augustus, the most fortunate and
    discerning of Roman statesmen. Augustus
    began a new system of government, based, no
    doubt, on the ideas of Julius, which lasted,
    gradually developing itself, till the fifth century
    of our era. Virgil, the poet of the new
    Roman spirit, kept that spirit alive into the
    Middle Ages, and rightly read, he keeps it
    still before us.</p>
<p>If Virgil had lived in an ordinary age, when
    the flow of events was smooth and unruffled,
    he might have been a great poet, but hardly
    one of the world’s greatest. But he lived in
    a crisis of the history of civilisation, and he
    was called to do his part in it. For a century
    before he wrote, the one great fact in the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
    world was the marvellous growth of the
    Roman dominion. When he was born,
    seventy years before the Christian era, Rome
    was the only great civilised power left, and
    a few years later it looked as if she had not
    even a barbarian rival to menace her, except
    the Parthians far away in the East. The
    Roman was everywhere, fighting, trading, ruling;
    nothing of importance could be done without
    the thought—What will Rome say to it?</p>
<p>Yet just as Virgil was growing to manhood
    it became obvious, as we have seen, that this
    great power was in reality on the verge of
    breaking up. She had abandoned justice
    and duty, and given herself to greed and
    pleasure. Her government was rapacious:
    she was sucking the life-blood of the nations.
    She had lost her old virtues of self-sacrifice,
    purity of family life, reverence for the divine.
    The rulers of the world had lost the sense of
    duty and discipline; they were divided into
    jarring political factions, and had felt the
    bitterness of civil war, in which men killed
    each other in cold blood almost for the sake
    of killing. But with Julius Cæsar’s strong
    hand and generous temper it must have
    seemed to many that a better time was coming,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
    and among these was the young poet
    from Mantua under the rampart of the Alps.</p>
<p>No one who knows Virgil’s poems well
    can have any doubt that all his hopes for
    himself and his family, for Italy and the
    Empire, were bound up with the family of the
    Cæsars. The sub-alpine region in which he
    was born and bred had been for ten years of
    his boyhood and youth under the personal
    rule of the great Julius, and had supplied him
    with the flower of that famous army that had
    conquered first Gaul and then the world. It
    is possible that the poet owed his position
    as a Roman citizen to the enlightened policy
    of Cæsar. Even now we cannot read without
    a thrill of horror the splendid lines in which
    he records the eclipse of the sun and the
    mourning of all nature when the great man
    was murdered by so-called patriots.<a class="fn" id="fr_12"
                                          href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_12">[12]</a>
    With
    such patriots, with the rapacious republican
    oligarchy, he could have had no sympathy,
    and there is not a trace of it in his poems.
    When, during the civil wars that followed the
    murder, he was turned out of his ancestral
    farm near Mantua to make room for veteran
    soldiers, he owed the recovery of it to the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
    master of those soldiers, the second Cæsar,
    whom henceforward he regarded not only as
    his own protector and friend, but as the one
    hope of the Empire.</p>
<p>Now this younger Cæsar, nephew and
    adopted son of Julius, though not a great
    soldier or a hero in any sense, was yet one of
    those rare men who learn wisdom in adversity,
    and use it to overcome passion and violence
    in themselves and others. He came gradually
    to see that Italy and the world could not be
    rescued from misery and despair by war and
    strong government alone. He grasped the
    fact, which Sulla had missed, that the one
    thing wanting was loyalty—loyalty to himself
    and belief in his mission: loyalty to Rome
    and Italy, and belief in their mission in the
    world. Confidence in him, and in the destiny
    of Rome, might create in men’s minds a
    hope for the future, a new self-respect, almost
    a new faith. Divided and depressed as they
    were, he wanted to set new ideals before
    them, and to get them to help him loyally
    towards the realisation of those ideals.
    Economically, morally, religiously, Italy was
    to rise to new life in an era of peace and
    justice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>This may seem too grand an ideal for a man
    like Augustus Cæsar, who (as I have said)
    was no hero, and who certainly was no philosopher.
    But it is none the less true that he
    understood that “peace hath her victories
    no less renowned than war”: and that his
    own conviction, based, perhaps, on shrewd
    political reasonings, inspired his poets and
    historians to hail a new age of peace and
    prosperity. In one way or another they all
    fell in with his ideas. Their themes are the
    glory and beauty of Italy, the greatness of
    Rome, the divine power which had given her
    the right to rule the world, and the story of
    the way in which she had come to exercise
    that right. But as Virgil is the greatest figure
    in the group, so is his <i>Æneid</i> the greatest
    work in which those ideas are immortalised.
    The Roman Empire has vanished, the ancient
    city, which rose in fresh magnificence under
    Augustus, has crumbled away; but the
    <i>Æneid</i> remains the one enduring monument
    of that age of new hope.</p>
<p>It is said that Augustus himself suggested
    to the poet the subject of the <i>Æneid</i>. If so,
    it was characteristic of a man who used every
    chance of extending his own fame and influence
    <span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
    without forcing them on the attention
    of his people. If a poem was to be written on
    the great theme of the revival of Rome and
    Italy, Augustus himself could not of course
    be the hero of it, nor even Julius: political
    and artistic feeling alike forbade. But a
    hero it must have, and he must be placed, not
    in the burning light of the politics of the day,
    but in the dim distance of the past. Such a
    hero was found in the mythical ancestor of
    the Julian family, Æneas, son of Venus and
    Anchises. A legend, familiar to educated
    Romans, told how this Trojan hero, whose
    personality appears in Homer, wandered over
    the seas after the fall of Troy, and landed at
    last in Italy; how he subdued the wild tribes
    then dwelling in Latium, brought peace and
    order and civilisation, and was under the
    hand of destiny the founder of the great
    career of Rome. His son Iulus, whose name
    the Julii believed themselves to bear, was
    in the legend the founder of the city from
    which Rome herself was founded; and thus
    the family of the Cæsars, the rescue of Italy
    from barbarism, and the foundation of the
    Eternal City, might all be brought into connexion
    with the story of Æneas the Trojan.
    <span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
    Here, then, was the hero, the type of which
    the antitype was to be found in Augustus.</p>
<p>And this is how the <i>Æneid</i> became a great
    national and a great imperial poem. It
    created a national hero, and endowed him
    with the best characteristics of his race, and
    especially with that sense of duty which the
    Romans called <i>pietas</i>: this is why it became
    a great national poem. It connected him
    with the famous stories of Greece and of
    Troy, and made him prophetically the ancestor
    of the man who was rescuing the Empire
    from ruin: this is why it became a great imperial
    poem. The idea was a noble one, and
    Virgil rose to his subject. Though the <i>Æneid</i>
    has drawbacks which for a modern reader detract
    from the general effect, yet whenever
    the poet comes upon his great theme the tone
    is that of a full organ. Even in a translation,
    though he cannot feel the witchery of Virgil’s
    magic touch, the reader may recognise and
    welcome the recurrence of that great theme,
    and so learn how its treatment made the poem
    the world’s second great epic. It instantly
    took a firm hold on the Roman mind; it
    came to be looked on almost as a sacred book,
    loved and honoured as much by Christian
    <span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
    Fathers as by pagan scholars. Italy has
    given the world two of the greatest poems
    ever written: the <i>Æneid</i> of Virgil, and the
    <i>Divina Commedia</i> of Dante, in which the
    younger poet took the imaginary figure of his
    predecessor as his guide and teacher in his
    travel through the scenes of the nether world.</p>
<p class="tb">But we must now leave poetry for fact and
    action, and try to gain some idea of that work
    of Augustus which laid the solid foundation
    of a new imperial system; a system of which
    we moderns not only see the relics still around
    us, but feel unconsciously the influence in
    many ways. Augustus had found time to
    discover, since the death of Julius, that the
    work to be done would fall mainly into two
    great departments: (1) Rome and Italy
    must be loyal, contented, and at peace;
    (2) the rest of the Empire must be governed
    justly and efficiently. To this we must add
    that the whole must contribute, each part in
    due proportion, to its own defence and government,
    both by paying taxes and by military
    service.</p>
<p>1. The city of Rome, with a population
    of perhaps half a million, of all races and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
    degrees, had been a constant anxiety to
    Augustus so far, and had exercised far more
    power in the Empire than such a mixed and
    idle population was entitled to. He saw that
    this population must be well policed, and
    induced to keep itself in order as far as possible;
    that it must be made quite comfortable,
    run no risk of starvation, have confidence in
    the good-will of its gods, and enjoy plenty of
    amusement. Above all, it must believe in
    himself, in order to be loyal to his policy.
    When he returned to Rome after crushing
    Antony and Cleopatra, the Romans were
    already disposed to believe in him, and he did
    all he could to make them permanently and
    freely loyal. He divided the city into new
    sections for police purposes, and recruited
    corps of “watchmen” from the free population;
    he restored temples and priesthoods,
    erected many pleasant and convenient public
    buildings (thus incidentally giving plenty of
    employment), organised the supply of corn
    and of water, and encouraged public amusements
    by his own presence at them. He
    took care that no one should starve, or become
    so uncomfortable as to murmur or
    rebel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>But, on the other hand, he did not mean
    this motley population to continue to have
    undue influence on the affairs of the Empire.
    True, he gave them back their Free State (<i>respublica</i>),
    and you might see magistrates, Senate,
    and assemblies in the city, just as under
    the Republic. But the people of the city
    had henceforth little political power. The
    consuls and Senate were indeed far from idle,
    but the assemblies for election and legislation
    soon ceased to be realities. In elections no
    money was now to be gained by a vote, and
    in legislation the “people” were quite content
    with sanctioning the wisdom of Augustus
    and his advisers. At the beginning of
    the next reign it was possible to put nearly
    the whole of this business into the hands
    of the Senate, and the Roman people made
    no objection. Seeing that they were only
    a fraction of the free population of the
    Empire, it was as well that this should be
    so; the rest of the citizen body could not
    use their votes at a distance from Rome,
    and the Senate and the <i>princeps</i><a class="fn" id="fr_13"
                                             href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_13">[13]</a>
    (as
    Augustus and his immediate successors
    were called) represented the interests of
    <span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
    the Empire far better than the crowd of
    voters.</p>
<p>Of the work of Augustus in Italy we unluckily
    know very little, but what we do
    know shows that he worked on much the same
    principles as in the city. Italy was made
    safe and comfortable, and was now free from
    all warlike disturbance for a long period.
    Brigandage was suppressed: roads were
    repaired: agriculture and country life were
    encouraged in all possible ways. A book on
    agriculture written even in Augustus’s earlier
    years boasts of the prosperity of rural Italy,
    and Virgil’s poem on husbandry is full of the
    love and praise of Italian life and scenery.
    Here is a specimen—</p>
<div class="verse">
    <p class="t0">“But no, not Medeland with its wealth of woods,</p>
    <p class="t0">Fair Ganges, Hermus thick with golden silt,</p>
    <p class="t0">Can match the praise of Italy....</p>
    <p class="t0">Here blooms perpetual spring, and summer here</p>
    <p class="t0">In months that are not summer’s; twice teem the flocks:</p>
    <p class="t0">Twice does the tree yield service of her fruit.</p>
    <p class="lc"><span class="gs">. . . . . . .</span></p>
    <p class="t0">Mark too her cities, so many and so proud,</p>
    <p class="t0">Of mighty toil the achievement, town on town</p>
    <p class="t0">Up rugged precipices heaved and reared,</p>
    <p class="t0">And rivers gliding under ancient walls.”<a class="fn" id="fr_14"
                                                             href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_14">[14]</a>
    </p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>2. The peaceful state of Rome and Italy
    made it possible for Augustus to undertake, in
    person to a great extent, the more important
    work of organising the rest of the Empire. He
    found it in a state of chaos almost as great as
    that of the Turkish Empire in our own time.
    He left it a strongly compacted union of
    provinces and dependent kingdoms grouped
    around the Mediterranean, which for a long
    time to come served two valuable purposes.
    First, it protected Mediterranean civilisation
    against barbarian attack, the most valuable
    thing done for us (as I said in my first chapter)
    by Roman organisation. Secondly, it
    gave free opportunity for the growth of that
    enlightened system of law which has been the
    other chief gift of Rome to modern civilisation.
    And also, though without any purpose
    on the part of the government—nay, in spite
    <span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
    of its strenuous opposition—it made possible
    the rapid growth of Christianity, during the
    next half-century, which seized on the great
    towns and the main lines of communication
    to spread itself among the masses of the
    people.</p>
<p>Augustus was able to do all this work
    beyond Italy quite legally, and as a servant
    of the State. He had succeeded in identifying
    himself, his family, and all his interests,
    with the State and its interests, in a way of
    which Sulla had never dreamt, and which had
    not been possible for Julius Cæsar. When he
    restored the Free State he divided the work
    of government with the Senate and the
    magistrates, and in this division he took care
    that the whole range of what we should call
    imperial and foreign affairs should fall to
    himself, with the sole command of the army.
    Thus he became supreme ruler of all provinces
    on or near the frontiers, appointed their
    governors, and kept them responsible to
    himself. If there was war on a frontier, it
    was carried through by his lieutenants, under
    his <i>imperium</i> and his auspices. For a governor
    to wage war on his own account was
    no longer possible, for it was made high
    <span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
    treason under a new and stringent law. The
    safety of the Empire, and especially of the
    frontier provinces, depended on the army, and
    the army was now identified once more in
    interest through Augustus with the State.</p>
<p>But of course a system like this would not
    work of itself; it needed constant looking
    after. Augustus knew this well, and knew
    also that he could not by himself either set
    it going or continue to look after it. It was
    part of his good fortune that he found a
    really capable and loyal helper in Agrippa,
    a tried soldier and organiser, who till his
    death in 12 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, during the most prosperous
    years of Augustus’s power, was able to identify
    his own interests with those of his friend
    and the State. The two worked admirably
    together, and between them found time to
    travel over the whole Empire, working hard
    at settlements of all kinds, and conducting
    military operations where they were absolutely
    necessary. It was the same kind of
    work, but on a far larger scale, as that of
    Pompeius after his conquests in the East:
    founding new cities, and settling the status
    of old ones: making treaties with kings
    and chieftains: arranging the details of
    <span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
    finance, land-tenure, and so on. Let us
    notice two important points in all this
    work of organisation, which will help to
    show how greatly in earnest Augustus was
    in his task of welding the Empire into
    real unity, and ruling it on rational principles.</p>
<p>First, he instituted for the first time
    (though Julius is said to have contemplated
    it) a complete survey, or <i>census</i> as the Romans
    called it, of all the material resources of the
    Empire, in order to ascertain what taxes all
    its free inhabitants ought to pay for purposes
    of government. Under the Republic there
    had never been such a survey, and the result
    was that abundant opportunity had been
    found for unfair taxation, and for extortion
    by corrupt officials. Now every house, field,
    and wood was duly valued by responsible
    officials, so that unjust exactions could be
    easily detected. By accurate keeping of
    accounts the government was able to tell
    what sums it ought to receive, and how much
    it had to spend; and we know that Augustus’s
    foreign policy was greatly influenced by such
    financial considerations. He kept a kind of
    yearly balance-sheet himself, and his successor
    <span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
    found the affairs of the Empire in
    perfect order.</p>
<p>Secondly, each province was now for the
    first time given a kind of corporate existence,
    and became something more than the military
    command of a Roman magistrate. A council
    of the province met once a year at its chief
    town, and transacted a certain amount of
    business. True, this did not give the province
    any measure of real self-government, but it
    had some useful results, and it is not impossible
    that Augustus may have intended that
    more should eventually follow. This meeting
    of a provincial council brought each province
    into direct touch with the home government,
    and in particular enabled it to make
    complaint of its governor if he had been
    unpopular and oppressive. And one most
    interesting feature of these councils was that
    they had a worship of their own, meant, no
    doubt, to dim the lustre of local and tribal
    worships, and to keep the idea of Rome
    and her rulers constantly before the minds
    of the provincials. For the divine objects
    of worship were Augustus himself or his
    Genius, in combination with the new goddess
    Roma. The most famous example of this
    <span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
    worship is found at Lugdunum, now Lyons,
    where there was an altar dedicated to Rome
    and Augustus, at the junction of Rhone and
    Saone, which served as a religious centre for
    the three provinces into which Augustus now
    divided the great area of the Gallic conquests
    of Julius.</p>
<p>Though his object was undoubtedly peace,
    Augustus could not, of course, entirely escape
    war on his frontiers. He could not have
    finally settled the frontier on the line of the
    Danube, which was far the most valuable
    military work of his time, without wars which
    were both long and dangerous. It was absolutely
    necessary to cover Italy on the northeast,
    where the passes over the Alps are low
    and comparatively easy, and also to shield
    the Greek peninsula from attack by the wild
    tribes to the north of it. I have already
    alluded to the great work of Tiberius (the
    stepson of Augustus) in this quarter, which
    marks him as the third of the great generals
    who saved the civilisation of the Mediterranean
    for us. At one time Augustus thought
    of advancing the frontier from the Rhine to
    the Elbe, and so of connecting Elbe and
    Danube in one continuous line of defence.
    <span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
    But this plan made it necessary to enclose all
    Germany west of the Elbe in the Roman
    Empire, and it was soon found that the
    Germans were not to be made into Roman
    provincials without a prolonged struggle for
    which Augustus had neither money nor inclination.
    So the frontier came back to
    the Rhine, and the Rhine and the sea
    marked the Roman frontier on north and
    west, until Claudius, the third successor
    of Augustus, added our island, or rather
    the southern part of it, to the Empire, in
    <span class="small">A.D.</span> 43.</p>
<p>In the East Augustus contrived to do without
    war, trusting, and rightly trusting, to the
    enormous prestige he had won by overcoming
    Antony and Cleopatra, and annexing the
    ancient kingdom of Egypt. His fame spread
    to India, and probably even to China, with
    the caravans of merchants who then as now
    passed along fixed routes from Syria and
    Egypt to the Far East. We Britons know
    what <i>prestige</i> can do among Orientals; it is a
    word that has often been in disfavour, but it
    means that there are ways of avoiding war
    without withdrawing just claims to influence.
    Augustus contrived on the strength of his
    <span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
    prestige to keep an honourable peace with
    the Parthians and Armenians who bordered
    on the Empire along the line of the Euphrates,
    and his successors would have kept it too had
    they always followed out his policy. Tiberius,
    his faithful pupil and successor, did follow
    out that policy, and showed consummate skill
    in handling it.</p>
<p>The mention of Tiberius, who succeeded
    to the position of Augustus at the end of his
    long life, suggests a few words about a weak
    point in the new system, which was to give
    some trouble in the future. How was the
    succession to be effected? Augustus had not
    made a new constitution; he had only engrafted
    his own position of authority on the
    old republican constitution. So at least he
    wished his position to be understood, and so
    he was careful to describe it in the record of
    his deeds which he left behind him, engraved
    on the walls of the great tomb which he built
    for himself and his family. In dignity and
    consequence he wished to be considered the
    first citizen; and this he expressed by the
    word <i>Princeps</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the first man in the State:
    by the name Augustus, which suggested to a
    Roman ear something in the nature of religious
    <span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
    sanctity: by the honorary title <i>pater
        patriæ</i> (father of his country), and in other
    ways. The real power in his hands had its
    basis and guarantee in the army, of which his
    <i>imperium</i> made him (as we should say) commander-in-chief;
    but the army was on the
    frontiers doing duty for the Empire, all but
    invisible to the Roman and Italian. Thus
    his <i>imperium</i>, though it might be legally used
    in Italy, was primarily a military power
    indispensable for the guardian of the frontiers.
    To the Italians it might well seem that
    the Free State was still maintained, and that
    no new permanent power had been established;
    though Greeks and foreigners might
    be, and indeed were, more discerning as to
    what had really happened.</p>
<p>But when Augustus died, in <span class="small">A.D.</span> 14, how
    was a succession to be effected? Or was there
    to be a succession at all—would it not be
    better to let the State pass back again into
    the hands of the Senate and people? This
    last was the only logical way, and it was the
    plan actually adopted in form. A position
    like that of Augustus could not pass to a
    successor, unless the State in its old constitutional
    form chose to appoint such a successor
    <span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
    with the same authority as that of
    Augustus. To this, however, we must add
    (and it well shows the real change that had
    been effected by the long revolution) that
    no choice of Senate and people could hold
    good unless the consent of the army could
    be had.</p>
<p>Of course, Augustus had considered all this,
    and had made his own plans. He would
    choose a member of his own family, one, that
    is, who inherited the name and fame of Cæsar
    by blood or adoption, would adopt him as a
    son (for he had no son of his own), make him
    his heir, associate him as far as possible in his
    own dignity and authority, and thus mark
    him out as the natural heir to the principate.
    This would make it difficult for Senate or
    army to refuse him; beyond that Augustus
    knew that he could not go. He was unlucky
    in losing one after another the youths whom
    he thus destined to succeed him, and eventually
    had to fall back on his stepson Tiberius:
    a great soldier, as we have seen, and a
    man of integrity and ability, but of reserved
    and even morose temper, and one with whom
    the shrewd and genial Augustus had little in
    common.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>When Augustus died there was an anxious
    moment. There was no reason why the
    principate should be confined to the family of
    the Cæsars, nor any reason but expediency
    for having a <i>princeps</i> at all. But, after all,
    the will of the dead ruler prevailed, and
    Tiberius slipped into his place without opposition;
    the Senate accepted him as plainly
    marked out by Augustus, and the army raised
    no difficulty, though his nephew Germanicus
    Cæsar was young, popular, and in actual
    command of the army on the Rhine. Some
    mocking voices were heard, and throughout
    his principate of twenty-three years
    Tiberius had to endure continual annoyance
    from the old republican families, but there
    was no real attempt to quarrel with the
    principate as an institution of the Roman
    State.</p>
<p>I have dwelt on this point at some length
    in order to show what a singular creation this
    principate of Augustus was. To proclaim
    monarchy outright would probably have been
    fatal; to take the whole work on himself
    would be to leave the old governing families
    idle and discontented; on the other hand, to
    do the necessary work as a yearly elected
    <span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
    magistrate, according to the old practice,
    was plainly impossible. Election by the
    people of the Roman city would have little
    force in the eyes of the Empire, and it was this
    Empire as a whole that Augustus wished to
    represent. The course he took shows him
    a shrewd, observant, tactical diplomatist, if
    ever there was one. He is not a man on whose
    character we dwell with sympathy or enthusiasm;
    he does not kindle our admiration like
    C. Gracchus or Cæsar; but he was essentially
    the man for the hour.</p>
<p>To him we owe in large measure the glories
    of “the Augustan age,” with its poets,
    historians, and artists; it was the “Augustan
    peace,” and the encouragement and patronage
    of Augustus, that enable Horace to write
    his perfect lyrics and his good-natured comments
    on human life, Ovid to pour forth his
    abundant stream of beautiful versification,
    Tibullus and Propertius to sing of the Italian
    country and its deities and festivals, and Livy,
    the greatest of Roman historians, to do in
    noble prose what Virgil had done in noble
    verse—to inspire Romans and Italians with
    enthusiasm for the great deeds of their ancestors.
    But the world owes Augustus a still
    <span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
    greater debt than this; for he laid securely
    the foundations of an imperial system strong
    enough to save for us, through centuries of
    danger, the priceless treasures of Græco-Roman
    civilisation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
    <br><span class="h2line2">LIFE IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE</span></h2>
<p>Now that we have seen the Empire made
    comparatively secure by Augustus, and set in
    the way of development on what seem to be
    rational principles, let us pause and try to
    gain some idea of the social life going on
    within it: excluding that of the city of Rome,
    which is no longer of the old paramount
    importance. How did the inhabitants of the
    Empire live and occupy themselves during
    the first two centuries of our era?</p>
<p>The first point to make quite sure of is that
    this life was in the main a life in towns. Roman
    policy had always favoured the maintenance
    of existing towns, except in the very
    rare cases where they were deemed too
    dangerous. Carthage and Corinth had been
    destroyed by Rome on this pretext, but they
    had been founded afresh by Julius Cæsar,
    and were now beginning a long and vigorous
    city life. In the East, where city-states
    <span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
    abounded, Rome retained and adorned them,
    or built new ones, as Pompey did after crushing
    Mithradates and Tigranes. In the West,
    in Gaul and Spain, where they did not exist
    at all, she founded some, and by a wonderfully
    wise policy favoured the natural growth
    of others. The people of these western
    provinces lived chiefly in some kind of villages,
    scattered over a district which we may
    call a canton, often, perhaps, as big as an
    English county of to-day. The Roman policy
    was either to found a city to serve as the
    centre of the canton, and to endow it with
    magistrates and senate on the Roman model:
    or to give the canton its senate and magistrates,
    and leave it to develop its own
    town-centre.</p>
<p>This policy shows extremely well the genius
    of Rome for civilising, or Romanising, without
    destroying the grouping and the habits
    of the people to be civilised, or Romanised.
    The old tribal (or cantonal) system remained,
    and its officers were the chiefs of the old population;
    but they now bore Roman names,
    <i>duoviri</i>, <i>quæstores</i>, and so on, and sat in an
    assembly called <i>ordo</i>—i.e. senate. If a town
    were not founded at once, in which the business
    <span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
    of the canton could be carried on, it was
    certain to grow of itself. A purely rural
    region, where the people live in villages only,
    was contrary to Roman interests and traditions;
    it was inconvenient for raising taxes,
    and it did not give those opportunities of
    culture and amusement which the Roman
    looked for when he travelled or settled in a
    province. The provincials, too, were in this
    way made more happy and contented; town
    life greatly helped in civilising them, attracting
    the better or richer people from the
    villages.</p>
<p>To help us in realising this urban character
    of Roman provincial life, we may compare it
    with that of our fellow-subjects in India at the
    present day. India is in the main a rural
    country, and by far the great majority of its
    inhabitants live on the land and support themselves
    by agriculture. Only about 30,000,000
    live in towns, as against 235,000,000 in the
    rural districts, and the few great cities are
    rather industrial and commercial centres
    than homes of culture and amusement. The
    economic unit of India is the village, and this
    simple fact is enough to explain why India
    never has been Anglicised. Instinctively the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
    Romans perceived that if a province were to be
    Romanised, the process could not be set going
    in villages; and where there were only villages,
    they gave the districts the opportunity
    of developing towns in their midst. The
    opportunity, we may reasonably suppose, was
    rarely missed, for at all times in their history
    the Romans had a wonderful power of making
    their subjects eager to imitate their own
    institutions. Thus Spain, Gaul, and even
    Britain, became rich in towns after the Roman
    model—towns which served to humanise the
    people, while making them obedient subjects.</p>
<p>Let us now see, with the help of a few
    striking examples, how, by the second century
    of our era, the Empire was covered with
    towns. For Italy and Greece we do not need
    illustrations—we are already well aware of
    the fact. But even far away in the East, in
    regions where the Greeks had never settled,
    if the Romans came to stay they left cities
    behind them. Look, for example, at a map of
    Syria or Palestine, and note the great caravan
    route leading from Damascus southwards
    on the east side of the Jordan, a road important
    to Rome because it carried the merchandise
    of the Far East to Damascus and the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
    Mediterranean by way of the Persian Gulf
    and Petra. Before the traveller of to-day
    has gone far south from Damascus he will
    come on the splendid ruins of two successive
    cities built by the Romans in this period,
    Gerasa and Philadelphia, where the sheep
    now graze among the ruins of temples,
    theatres, and baths. A famous English
    traveller<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_15">[15]</a>
    wrote of them long ago that they
    enabled him to form some conception of the
    grandeur and might of the Roman Empire:
    “That cities so far removed from the capital,
    and built almost in the desert, should have
    been adorned with so many splendid monuments,
    afforded one of the most striking
    proofs of the marvellous energy and splendid
    enterprise of that great people who had subjected
    the world.”</p>
<p>The mention of Damascus may remind us
    of a traveller of the first century <span class="small">A.D.</span> whose
    journeys are fortunately recorded and admirably
    illustrate the fact that in Asia Minor
    and Greece the life of the people was centred
    in the great cities. St. Paul went from city
    to city, choosing by preference for his missionary
    work the most populous ones, such as
    <span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
    Antioch, Ephesus, Thessalonica, Corinth and
    Athens.</p>
<p>Passing westwards, and leaving out of account
    the many cities of Egypt, we shall
    find that what has been so far said holds good
    of the Roman province of Africa. This
    province eventually became one of the most
    highly cultured as well as populous, mainly
    owing to its numerous towns. Of many of
    these the remains still astonish the traveller.
    A photograph lies before me of one of them
    which still stands almost in the desert, silent
    and abandoned, with temples, streets, and all
    the belongings of a great city as perfect as
    at the excavated Pompeii, which was overwhelmed
    in this period by the great eruption
    of Vesuvius. An inscription tells us that
    Thamugadi was founded in the year <span class="small">A.D.</span> 100,
    and built with the help of a legion of Roman
    soldiers to guard civilisation against the
    marauders of the desert. Another of these
    towns is a good example of the way in which
    the army contributed to the policy of creating
    town-centres; Lambæsis, now called Djebel-Aures,
    was the permanent station of a military
    force, round which there grew up a civil
    population of traders and camp-followers.
    <span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
    Great roads, here as everywhere in the Empire,
    connected these towns with each other
    and with the capital of the province, in this
    case Carthage.</p>
<p>If we cross the sea from Africa to Gaul or
    Spain we shall find the same process going on.
    Spain we must pass by; but in Gaul we land
    at the ancient Greek city of Massilia, which,
    as Marseilles, is still the great port of southern
    France. A little to the north, Nismes
    (Nemausus) was formed into a city by Augustus
    out of a rural population; its vast Roman
    amphitheatre and an exquisitely beautiful
    temple belong to the second century, and still
    stand in the middle of the modern city.
    Lyons was also founded by Augustus, as we
    saw in the last chapter, with a special purpose.
    Farther north the cities on the great
    roads were gradually formed, out of tribal
    populations living in villages, and many of
    them still bear the names of those tribes:
    Paris is the town-centre of the Parisii,
    Rheims of the Remisii, Soissons of the
    Suessiones, Trier of the Treveri. This
    last city, on the Moselle, now a German
    one, can boast of more imposing Roman
    work than any north of Italy, and is within
    <span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
    comparatively easy reach of visitors from
    our shores.</p>
<p>Britain, which was invaded and made a
    province in the reign of Claudius, was never
    so fully Romanised as other provinces, partly
    owing to the wild and stubborn nature of its
    inhabitants; but even in our midst the Roman
    has left obvious traces of his belief in town
    life. London was a trading centre before the
    coming of the Romans, and they maintained
    it as such; but nearly all their other towns
    had a more directly military origin and object.
    The oldest of them is Colchester, a military
    colony, which still has its Roman walls. Then
    came St. Albans (Verulamium), Gloucester,
    Chester, Lincoln and York, strategical points
    of importance, where populous cities still
    stand. In a few cases towns have disappeared,
    and have only been recovered by
    excavation, <i>e.g.</i> Calleva (Silchester, near
    Basingstoke), the town-centre of the Atrebates;
    but many of our country towns,
    besides those just mentioned, still stand on
    ancient Roman sites, and even without much
    excavation have yielded traces of their
    Roman inhabitants. One, and one only,
    Dorchester, still boasts of a complete little
    <span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
    amphitheatre, which stands just outside the
    town between the Great Western and South
    Western railways, and has been used by Mr.
    Thomas Hardy for a scene in one of his
    novels. All our towns and villages of which
    the names contain the word <i>chester</i> or <i>cester</i>
    are Roman in origin, though they may not
    have been large cities like Gloucester (Glevum);
    for <i>chester</i> is only our English form of
    <i>castra</i>, the Latin for a military encampment.</p>
<p>If it is now quite clear that the town is the
    unit of civilisation in the Empire, what was
    the social and political life of the town? Of
    this we know now much more than we used to
    do, for it is mirrored in the many thousands
    of inscriptions from every Roman province,
    which have now at last been collected and
    correctly published under the direction of
    the famous Theodor Mommsen, whose name
    cannot be omitted entirely, even in such an
    unpretending book about Rome as this. In
    records on stone there is, indeed, something
    lacking that can only be supplied by literature,
    which reports more elaborately and
    earnestly the thoughts and feelings of men;
    and in the Empire, apart from Italy and
    Rome, there is but little literature to help
    <span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
    us out. But the inscriptions supply us with
    the necessary facts.</p>
<p>First, of the political condition of these
    innumerable towns we may say that it shows
    diversity in unity. There were several grades
    of privilege among them. Some were nominally
    independent of the Roman government,
    and in alliance with it, but these were few;
    Athens is the most famous example. Others
    were communities of Roman citizens; and
    many had the Latin right, <i>i.e.</i> inferior
    privilege. Lastly, there were great numbers
    of cities—a majority of the whole number—whose
    inhabitants were not Roman citizens
    at all, but directly under the control of the
    governor of their province, who was limited
    in his authority over the more privileged and
    independent towns. So much for diversity.</p>
<p>But all the cities were in reality governed
    and organised in much the same way. In
    each there was a constitution closely resembling
    that of Rome, and in most instances
    modelled directly upon it. As at Rome, they
    had yearly elected magistrates, who, after
    holding office, passed into a senate of advisers
    and councillors; and these magistrates were
    elected by the <i>populus</i>, or the whole body of
    <span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
    citizens. Here was plenty of useful work to
    do, as we can guess from our own experience
    of local self-government. Plutarch, writing in
    this period of his own little town of Chæronea
    in Greece, realises this to the full, and urges
    that the work of the magistrate is honourable
    work, and the more so as it is combined with
    the sense of citizenship in a great empire.</p>
<p>There was, however, a tendency in these
    provincial towns, as in the city of Rome
    itself, for the magistrate, who must be a man
    of substance, to undertake the expense of
    amusing the people; a tendency to make the
    people dependent on the rich for their comforts
    rather than on their own industry and
    exertion. The magistrate, besides paying a
    large fee on his accession to office, was expected
    to give public games, to feast the
    people, or to give them a present of money
    all round. And he would wish, too, to distinguish
    his magistracy by erecting some
    public buildings—a bath, aqueduct, or
    theatre; or to endow a school. So it came
    to pass in course of time that his burdens
    were heavier than he could bear, and that
    the whole class to which he belonged, the
    senatorial one, was involved in the same
    <span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
    difficulties. This class could not be recruited
    from the common people, who rarely
    had the means, or, indeed, the energy, to rise
    to affluence; and the tendency as time went
    on was to draw the line ever more sharply
    between the dignity of the various classes.
    But the ruin of the senatorial class, or <i>curiales</i>,
    lies outside our limits.</p>
<p>The lower class was engaged in industry,
    either on the land, or in the town itself. This
    industry was not to any large extent employed
    by capital, nor was it in competition
    with slave-labour, of which in provincial
    towns we do not hear much. The members
    of the various trades and callings worked on
    their own account, but were almost invariably
    grouped together in gilds or associations, and
    these are one of the most interesting features
    in the life of this period. Each of these gilds
    was licensed, or should have been licensed,
    by the central government at Rome—a good
    example of the way in which the long arm of
    that government reached to every provincial
    town through the agency of the provincial
    governor and his officials. Illegal association
    was a serious crime, and this was one
    of the reasons why the small Christian communities
    <span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
    were looked on with suspicion by the
    government.</p>
<p>What was the object of these associations?
    The question has often been asked whether
    they were in any sense provident societies like
    our friendly societies, and, on the whole, the
    conclusion of investigators has been that they
    were not. If we had more literature dealing
    with provincial life, or such a correspondence
    as that of Cicero and his friends, we could give
    a more certain answer.</p>
<p>But in one sense at least they may be called
    provident societies. All, or nearly all, of
    them had as one main object the assurance of
    a proper tomb and decent funeral for the
    members. This object can only be fully appreciated
    after some real study of the social
    life and religion of that and the preceding age,
    but when it is understood it is inexpressibly
    touching. It would seem that the life of the
    working man of that day was by no means
    an unhappy one, that he was not driven or
    enslaved by an employer nor forced to live
    in grimy and unwholesome surroundings. So
    far as we can tell he had little anxiety in this
    life, and worshipped his gods, and performed
    his vows to them, with genuine gratitude.
    <span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
    But that he should be utterly neglected and
    forgotten after death, thrown into some
    common grave to moulder away unnoticed,
    “where no hand would bring the annual
    offering of wine and flowers”—this seems to
    have been the shadow ever hanging over his
    life. We may doubt whether the hope of
    immortality had, as a rule, anything to do
    with this anxiety. It was rather an inherited
    instinct than a faith or creed that moved these
    poor people. Originally it had been the desire
    not to have to wander as a ghost for want
    of due burial; now it is rather the fear that
    they might be forgotten by those left behind,
    or, indeed, by future generations.</p>
<p>The instinct of association is common to
    man, and in a vast empire, where the tendency
    was, and long had been, to obliterate the old
    social grouping of kinship, real or supposed, it
    would be some consolation to belong to a club
    of friends with common interests, accustomed
    to share the joys and perils of life, and
    bent on decent burial when death should
    overtake them. Even in this life they would
    meet from time to time to eat, drink and
    enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>On the whole, we may conclude that this
    <span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
    life of the towns was a happy one, so long as
    the frontiers were well guarded and no sudden
    raid or invasion by an enemy was likely; so
    long, too, as person and property were
    securely protected under Roman law administered
    without corruption, and amusements
    and conveniences were to be had for
    little or nothing. But undoubtedly something
    was wanting; there was mischief in the
    social system somewhere, though it was not
    easy to lay finger upon it. The sap was running
    in the plant too feebly; there was a lack
    of keen industrial energy and of the instinct
    of self-help. As time went on, the central
    government grew too paternal, interfered too
    much in the life of these towns, and so encouraged
    the tendency to “slackness.” And
    more and more, as pressure came on the
    Empire from without, the play of life in
    these once happy cities became an automatic
    movement of machinery, the central wheel
    of which was the Cæsar at Rome.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the life of the provincial
    towns must be mentioned here, which suggests
    that the trend of the time was not
    entirely healthy. I said at the beginning of
    this book that the great monuments left behind
    <span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
    her by Rome were mainly of a useful and
    practical kind, <i>e.g.</i> roads, aqueducts, places of
    business. This is true, but it is now necessary
    to add that some of the most imposing of
    these fabrics were, in the period we have now
    reached, entirely devoted to amusement, and
    amusement of a kind neither educating nor
    humane. The taste had long been growing at
    Rome for spectacles of bloodshed—combats
    of gladiators, and the hunting of wild beasts
    in a confined space; and from Rome this
    degraded taste passed only too rapidly into
    the provinces. Most large provincial towns
    had their amphitheatre, in imitation of the
    huge one at Rome, which we know as the
    Coliseum; and the more fully Romanised a
    province was, the more of these homes of
    inhumanity were to be found in it. The most
    magnificent one still standing outside Italy,
    that at Nismes, dates, strange to say, from
    the mild and enlightened age of the Antonines,
    to which we are coming in the next chapter.
    The Greeks, indeed, never took much interest
    in such shows; but in the western provinces,
    where the best and most virile populations of
    the Empire were now to be found, their effect
    was beyond doubt pernicious, for they encouraged
    <span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
    not only inhumanity, but idleness.
    Day after day the greater part of the population
    of a city might sit and watch lazily these
    bloody entertainments, on which, perhaps,
    some wealthy citizen was wasting his capital
    to his own ruin.</p>
<p>As may, perhaps, be said of ourselves in this
    present age, the Romans of the Empire were
    being encouraged to live too much in the enjoyment
    of the present, without anxiety for the
    future. So, too, the cultured classes gradually
    came to look back at the past, to the great
    achievements of Rome in war and literature,
    as all in all to them, and lost the desire to
    strike out new lines, to make new discoveries,
    to try new experiments. “Over all, to our
    eyes, there broods the shadow which haunts
    the life that is nourished only by memories,
    and to which the future sends no call and
    offers no promise.”<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_16">[16]</a>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
    <br><span class="h2line2">THE EMPIRE UNDER THE ANTONINES—CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>The chief work of Rome in the world, as
    has often been said in this little book, was the
    defence of Mediterranean civilisation against
    external enemies. That work was of a double
    nature. It could not be done simply by
    marking out and holding lines of frontier; it
    was also necessary so to organise the Empire
    within its frontiers that the whole should
    contribute to the common object, with men,
    money and public spirit. The last two
    chapters will have shown that from the time
    of Julius and Augustus Roman rulers fully
    recognised this twofold nature of their task.
    Augustus in particular, while gradually settling
    the frontiers on a system well thought
    out, and adapted to his means and experience,
    also spent much time and pains on internal
    organisation. He found the Empire a loose
    collection of subject territories, each governed,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
    well or ill as it might happen, by an
    officer almost independent of the central
    authority; he left it, at the end of his long
    life, in the way of becoming a well-compacted
    whole, in which every part felt more or less
    the force of a just central government; a
    civilised State “standing out in clear relief
    against the surrounding barbarism.”</p>
<p>In such an empire there must, of course, be
    differences of race and language—differences,
    too, of habits, feelings, modes of thought; but
    under just and wise rule such differences need
    be no hindrance to the political unity of the
    whole. There is a book of this period, within
    the reach of every one, which illustrates better
    than any other this unity in diversity of the
    Roman Empire—I mean the Acts of the
    Apostles. It should be studied carefully,
    with maps and such other helps as may be
    available, down to the last chapter, where it
    leaves St. Paul at Rome, living in his own
    hired house, in the centre of Mediterranean
    life and government.</p>
<p>Under the immediate successors of Augustus,
    Tiberius, Claudius and Nero, his policy
    was, on the whole, maintained with good faith
    and discretion; and at the close of the first
    <span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
    century <span class="small">A.D.</span> Vespasian and his two sons,
    Titus and Domitian, did little more than
    improve the working of the machinery of his
    government. More and more, it is true, the
    constitution became a real monarchy; the
    part played in it by the Senate of the free
    State was getting steadily narrowed; but this
    was all in the interest of efficiency, and, so far
    as we can see, it was necessary to the internal
    development of the Empire. The Cæsars of
    the first century must have the credit of ruling
    wisely, with the help of their advisers,
    on the Augustan principles. True, the great
    literary genius of the age, the historian Tacitus,
    by drawing brilliant and lurid portraits
    of some of them, has diverted our attention
    from their work as agents of a great system;
    but to tell their story as Tacitus has told it
    is neither possible nor necessary here. I may
    pass them over and go on to the second century
    and the age of the Antonines, which has
    rightly been judged by historians to be the
    most brilliant and the happiest in all Roman
    history.</p>
<p>That four men of what seems to us “right
    judgment in all things” should succeed each
    other in power at this critical time, is one
    <span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
    more example of the wonderful good fortune
    of Rome. All were men of capacity and education,
    hard workers and conscientious, and
    they seem to have communicated their good
    qualities to their subordinates, for they never
    wanted for loyal helpers. The Senate, indeed,
    was now of little avail for actual work,
    and the greater part of the business had long
    been done by Cæsar<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_17">[17]</a>
    and his own “servants,”
    freedmen for the most part, often ambitious
    and unscrupulous Greeks; but in this period,
    as we shall see directly, the civil service, as
    we may call it, was placed on a sound and
    honourable basis. It would seem as if the
    ideas of duty and discipline were once more
    to prevail throughout the Roman official
    world.</p>
<p>The first of the four rulers, Ulpius Trajanus,
    known to us all as Trajan, was not of Roman
    or even Italian birth, but came from the province
    of further Spain: a fact which marks
    the growth of the idea that every part of the
    Empire may now be turned to account for the
    common good. Trajan was a soldier by
    <span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
    breeding and disposition, and his contribution
    to the work of this period was mainly a
    military one. The frontier along the Danube,
    the last (as we have seen) to be settled, had
    always been the weakest; and yet here henceforward
    was to be the most dangerous point
    in the Empire’s line of defence. Along the
    whole length of the lower Danube a great
    mass of barbarian tribes was already pressing,
    pressed themselves from behind by others to
    north and east. And here, to the north of the
    river, a great kingdom had been founded by
    a king of the Dacian people, which corresponds
    roughly with the modern Roumania.
    A glance at a map of the Empire will show
    that such a kingdom would be a standing
    menace to Italy, to Greece, and even to the
    peninsula of Asia Minor, and from the Roman
    point of view Trajan was quite justified in his
    determination to conquer and annex it. He
    carried out this policy in two successive wars,
    with consummate daring and skill. Dacia
    became a Roman province, and lasted as such
    long enough (about 200 years) to be an effectual
    help to imperial defence in this quarter.
    The story of the two wars is told in the
    marvellous series of sculptures forming a
    <span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
    spiral round the column of Trajan, which
    stood and still stands at Rome in the forum
    built by him and called by his name.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his life Trajan embarked
    on a new policy in the East, and failed
    to carry it out. The shrewd Augustus, as we
    saw, had trusted here to his prestige, knowing
    that war in this region was both perilous and
    expensive. Since then both peril and expense
    had been incurred here under Nero, and no
    definite results had been gained. Trajan,
    however, provoked by a move of the Parthian
    king, made up his mind to seize Armenia, the
    old bone of contention between Rome and
    Parthia, and not only did this, but added by
    conquest two other provinces, Mesopotamia
    and Assyria. Some historians have thought
    his judgment as good here as it was on the
    Danube. The best way of deciding the question
    is to look carefully at a map of the Empire
    and then to ask oneself whether these territories
    were really needed for the protection
    of Mediterranean civilisation. For myself I
    unhesitatingly answer in the negative; but
    there is no need to dispute the point here, as
    Trajan died before he had made his conquests
    secure. The Jews dispersed all over these
    <span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
    regions, urged by their implacable hatred of
    Rome, stirred up rebellion in Trajan’s rear
    with alarming ferocity, and in the middle of
    this turmoil he died on his way back to Rome.
    His successor Hadrian at once renounced any
    attempt to keep the new provinces.</p>
<p>It would be unjust to the memory of a great
    man if we were to think of Trajan as a soldier
    only. He was a strenuous man, unsparing
    of himself in any part of his duty. He pursued
    a policy of public benefit in Italy,
    striving, like Augustus, to encourage agriculture
    and population, and carrying out a plan
    of his predecessor Nerva for providing a fund
    for the education of poor children. This last
    institution became an important one, and
    shows well how really benevolent—perhaps
    even to excess—how anxious for the well-being
    of Italy, were the Cæsars of the second
    century. Money was lent by the State to
    the Italian farmers in need of it, and the
    interest, at five per cent., was appropriated to
    the education of boys up to eighteen and girls
    up to fourteen years of age.</p>
<p>Trajan bestowed the same minute care on
    the provinces. In most of these there was
    no trouble, but in one case, Bithynia, which
    <span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
    had been under Senatorial governors, he had
    to send out a special commissioner to repair
    neglect and mischief. Luckily for us it
    happened that this commissioner was Pliny
    the younger, nephew of the great encyclopædist
    of the same name; and Pliny was so
    prominent a figure of the time that his correspondence
    has been preserved. That part of
    it which contains his letters to Trajan, and
    Trajan’s brief and pithy answers, is one of the
    most precious treasures that have survived
    from ancient literature. Pliny consults him
    on a variety of details, some of them almost
    ludicrously petty, some of them of general
    importance, such as a famous one about his
    policy towards the Christians; and the answers
    show us Trajan as a shrewd and sensible
    man, fully aware that in such a unity
    as the Roman Empire there must needs be
    diversity, and that governors must learn to
    adapt themselves to such diversity without
    losing hold of the principles of justice and
    equity. Before we leave this subject it may
    be as well to mention that this constant
    interchange of letters between persons more
    than a thousand miles apart need astonish
    no one. In the interest of imperialism the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
    public posts had been thoroughly organised
    by Augustus; the roads were excellent, the
    shipping well seen to, and travelling was at
    least as easy and rapid as it was in England
    less than a century ago.</p>
<p>Trajan’s strong and rather rugged features,
    familiar to all students of the Empire, are in
    striking contrast to those of his three successors.
    He was clean shaven, but his next
    successor, Hadrian, introduced the practice of
    wearing his beard, and this was adhered to.
    All the imperial portraits of this age, as preserved
    on coins and sculptures, are perfectly
    authentic, and the likenesses are consistent.
    In the British Museum the reader may see the
    features of these great Cæsars as faithfully
    reproduced as those of British statesmen in
    the National Portrait Gallery.</p>
<p>Trajan was succeeded by his cousin Hadrian,
    beyond doubt one of the most capable
    and efficient men who ever wielded great
    power. No one can study his reign without
    feeling that it was better in this age, if an
    efficient man could be found, that his hand
    alone should be on the helm. Probably
    Hadrian was only one of many who might
    have done as well as he did, for there was now
    <span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
    a spirit abroad of intelligent industry directed
    to the good of the State; yet it is almost
    certain that the Empire was the better for
    not having the sovereignty put into commission.
    It has been well said of Hadrian
    that he desired “to see himself all that was to
    be seen, to know all that was to be known,
    to do all that was to be done”; and subsequent
    events proved that this intelligent
    industry could hardly have been carried all
    through the imperial work with equal effect,
    had it been shared with others.</p>
<p>Hadrian accomplished his work by two
    long periods of travel, each lasting some four
    years. Without any pomp or state he made
    himself acquainted with all parts of the Empire
    and their needs, as no ruler had done
    since Augustus and Agrippa shared such a
    task between them. The more immediate
    object was to inspect the frontiers and secure
    them, and as Hadrian was a trained soldier,
    with much experience under Trajan, this was
    to him familiar work. But he was so full
    of curiosity, so anxious to see all that the
    Empire had to show him, that while he
    practised his indefatigable industry he could
    also gratify his intelligence. In this he was
    <span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
    more like Julius Cæsar than any other Roman
    we know of, though in most traits of character
    he was very different from that great
    man. It is not possible here to describe
    Hadrian’s frontier work in detail, but a
    specimen of it shall be given which should be
    interesting to British readers.</p>
<p>Britain had been invaded by Claudius in
    the previous century, and the southern part
    of the island had been made into a Roman
    province. Since then the frontier had been
    pushed farther north, and the frontier strongholds
    were no longer Colchester and Gloucester,
    but Lincoln, Chester and York. Hadrian
    spent several months here in the course of his
    first journey, and his visit had a remarkable
    result which we can see with our eyes at this
    moment. He must have noted two facts:
    first, the unsettled and rebellious condition
    of the natives of Yorkshire and Northumberland
    (Brigantes): and secondly, the narrow
    waist of the island between the Solway Firth
    and the mouth of the Tyne. He must have
    reasoned that if Roman forces could be permanently
    established on a fortified line between
    the two seas, this line would serve as
    a check on the Brigantes, and also as a base
    <span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
    of operations for further advance northwards.</p>
<p>Thus it is that “Hadrian’s wall” remains
    as the most striking of all Roman works in
    our island. It is about seventy miles long,
    and consisted eventually (for we cannot be
    sure that it was completed by Hadrian) of a
    stone wall on the northern side, twenty feet
    high, an earthen rampart on the southern
    side, and a military road between them. At
    intervals there were fortified stations, seventeen
    in all, including the two which connected
    the lines with the sea; of these two the eastern
    one, near Newcastle, now famous for its
    collieries, is still known as <i>Wallsend</i>. The
    wall enabled the Romans to advance northwards,
    and soon another fortification was
    built on a smaller scale between the Forth and
    Clyde, about which a large volume has just
    been published by Dr. G. Macdonald, of
    Edinburgh. The conquest of the Highlands
    was never, indeed, carried out; but Hadrian’s
    great work had an immense moral effect on
    the population to the south of it, and Britain
    became very substantially Romanised.
    Towns and country houses (<i>villæ</i>) sprang up
    in abundance along or near the military
    <span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
    roads. As I write these lines in North Oxfordshire,
    I have the remains of several of
    these <i>villæ</i> within easy reach, and can visit,
    each in a day, at least four considerable
    Roman towns, viz. Cirencester, Gloucester,
    Silchester (Calleva), and last, but not least,
    Bath (Aquæ Sulis), where the Romans found
    and used, as they always did in such spots,
    the magnificent hot springs, building noble
    baths about them which may be seen to this
    day.</p>
<p>Hadrian’s care for the good working of the
    civil government was as great as his zeal for
    frontier defence. Two forward steps were
    taken by him in this department, both of
    which helped on that consolidation of the
    Empire which was his constant aim.</p>
<p>First, he organised and dignified the Civil
    Service, on which the actual good working
    of the whole system depended. Cæsar’s
    share in this work had steadily been increasing
    while that of the Senate diminished; yet
    Cæsar had so far done his part, as we saw just
    now, with the help only of his own personal
    “servants,” who were mostly freedmen, <i>i.e.</i>
    slaves by origin, and many of them Greeks.
    Hadrian now established a public imperial
    <span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
    civil service, of which the members must be
    Roman knights, <i>i.e.</i> men of a certain consequence
    in regard to birth and property.
    These new civil servants were excused all
    military service, and could thus be trained to
    the work without interruption, during their
    earlier years.</p>
<p>Secondly, we may date from Hadrian’s
    reign the beginning of the consolidation of
    Roman law, and the rise of a school of great
    lawyers such as the world has never known
    since. Apart from the defence of Mediterranean
    civilisation, to which, indeed, its indirect
    contribution was not small, this was the most
    valuable legacy of Rome to modern Europe.
    Law had originally consisted mainly of the old
    legal rules of the city-state of Rome, embodied
    in the Twelve tables, and a few statutes;
    but, in course of time, through the need of
    interpreting these, and adjusting them to the
    customs of other peoples in the Empire, an
    immense body of what we may call <i>judge-made
        law</i> had arisen in the form of edicts or
    public notices of magistrates, issued both in
    Italy and the provinces. As these customs
    were now well known, and as the Empire had
    reached its limits, it was possible to close
    <span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
    and consolidate this huge body of official
    decisions and precedents; and this was done
    under Hadrian’s direction. The other two
    sources of law were still to grow largely before
    they could be welded into the great “Body
    of Law” (<i>Corpus Juris</i>) compiled under the
    orders of Justinian in the sixth century,
    which is still the chief European textbook of
    legal studies. These two sources were the
    delivered opinions of wise lawyers on points of
    law, and the decisions of the Cæsars in various
    forms, all of which had the force of law.</p>
<p>The death of Hadrian in <span class="small">A.D.</span> 138 brings us
    to the third of the great Cæsars of this age,
    Titus Antoninus, a man who, at fifty-two, had
    already done excellent work for the Empire.
    He is known to history as Antoninus Pius,
    and this last name, given him apparently on
    his accession, may be a reminiscence of Virgil’s
    epithet for his hero, and may be due to
    the strong sense of duty which marked his
    whole life, public and private. He seems,
    indeed, vividly to recall the ideal of the
    Roman character as we traced it in the third
    chapter of this book; yet he was not Italian
    by birth. His family belonged to Nismes in
    southern Gaul, and that ancient city still
    <span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
    honours him with a “Place Antonin,” in
    which his statue stands. His features, as
    they appear on portrait busts, entirely confirm
    the account of him left us by his nephew
    and successor. Grave and wise, gentle yet
    firm, religious in the true old Roman sense,
    pure in life, and simple in all his needs and
    pleasures, he ruled over a peaceful and contented
    empire, devoting himself to the work
    of humanising and softening the life and lot
    of his subjects.</p>
<p>Let us glance, for example, at his attitude
    towards slavery, which, when we last noticed
    it, was threatening to become a deadly poison
    in the Roman system. During the first
    century of the Empire, chiefly under the influence
    of the Stoic philosophy, as later on under
    that of Christianity, there had been growing
    up a feeling that a slave was, after all, a human
    being, and had some claim to be treated
    as such under the Roman law, beneficent
    in its dealings with all other human beings.
    Antoninus followed out this new idea both in
    legislation and in his private life, as did his
    successor also, who adored his memory. They
    limited the right of a master over his slaves
    in several ways; ordaining that if cruelty were
    <span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
    proved against a master, he should be compelled
    to sell the slave he had ill-treated. It
    is noteworthy, too, that the philosopher in
    whom they most delighted, Epictetus, had
    himself originally been a slave. There is no
    better way of realising the spirit of humanity
    which actuated Antoninus and his successor
    than by making some acquaintance with the
    moral philosophy of Epictetus, and the <i>Meditations</i>
    of Marcus Aurelius. The <i>Golden Sayings
        of Epictetus</i>, in the Golden Treasury
    Series,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_18">[18]</a> and
    Dr. Rendall’s translation of the
    <i>Meditations</i>, will be of use to those who do
    not read Greek.</p>
<p>Hadrian had left the Empire well guarded,
    and it does not seem to have occurred to
    Antoninus to see for himself that Hadrian’s
    vigilance was maintained. This was the one
    weak point of his reign, and it cost his successors
    dear. He only once left Italy, and his
    mind was never occupied with wars or rumours
    of wars; he lived tranquilly, and died
    peacefully, without trouble or anxiety. But
    we know that even before his death clouds
    were beginning to gather on the northern
    frontier; and we cannot but feel that the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
    beautiful tranquillity of Antoninus’s life
    was hardly compatible with the duty of an
    imperial guardian.</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius, the author of the <i>Meditations</i>,
    succeeded his uncle and adoptive father
    in <span class="small">A.D.</span> 161. Though not the greatest of the
    four as a ruler, he was the most remarkable
    as a man, and holds a higher place than the
    others in the world’s esteem. We may find
    parallels in history to Trajan, less easily, perhaps,
    to Hadrian and Antoninus; but there
    is no monarch like Marcus, not even in the
    history of the Jews. It is, indeed, astonishing
    that Rome, Rome of the hard practical
    temperament, should have produced a ruler
    who was a philosopher and almost a saint, and
    yet capable of government. It is the last
    striking manifestation of the old Roman
    spirit of duty and discipline, now kindled into
    a real ethical emotion by the teaching of the
    Stoics, far the most inspiring creed then available
    for a man of action. Without any aid
    from Christianity, which, indeed, he could
    not understand and occasionally persecuted,
    Marcus learnt not only how to make his own
    life pure, but how to live and work for the
    world of his day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>But saintliness on the throne, as in the case
    of St. Louis of France, has its drawbacks in
    practical work. It is, perhaps, true that the
    mind of Marcus was more active, and found
    greater satisfaction, in questioning itself than
    in anxious inquiry into the state of the Empire.
    He was not one of those of whom our poet
    says that they do Duty’s work <i>and know it
        not</i>; and as a consequence his days were not
    serene and bright. He had a tendency to be
    morbid, and, like all morbid men, he was
    serious even to sadness. It has been well
    said of him that he is always insisting on his
    faith in a universe in which, nevertheless, he
    can find nothing but disappointment.</p>
<p>His sensitiveness about his duty sometimes
    warped his judgment and blunted his discernment
    of character. At the outset he made a
    bad blunder in dividing the imperial power
    with his brother by adoption, Lucius Verus,
    who had little principle and much leaning
    to pleasure. To him he committed the charge
    of a war with Parthia which became inevitable,
    and though the Roman arms were
    successful, this was not due to the skill or
    energy of either Marcus or Verus. Had a
    strong scientific mind been in command, it
    <span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
    might have been possible to avert or mitigate
    a calamity which now fell on the Mediterranean
    world, and had a share, perhaps a
    large one, in the decay and fall of the Empire.
    The legions brought back with them from the
    East one of the most terrible plagues known
    to history, which can only be compared for
    its effects with the Black Death in the fourteenth
    century.</p>
<p>Not only in the East, but nearer home,
    Marcus had to meet formidable foes who
    broke through the frontiers with which Hadrian
    had taken such pains. Pushed forward
    by pressure from the rear, German tribes
    unwillingly made their way into Roman
    territory, overran the new province of
    Dacia, crossed the Danube, and even passed
    over the Alps into Italy. Marcus’s difficulties
    were great, but he met them with patience
    and courage. The pestilence had so greatly
    thinned the population that both men and
    money were wanting for the war, and the
    struggle to drive back the unwilling invaders
    was prolonged for thirteen years. It was
    still going on when Marcus died of fever in
    camp at Vienna. As he closed his eyes in
    his tent he must have felt that he had spent
    <span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
    himself in vain, and that evil days were in
    store for the Empire. He left a worthless
    son, Commodus, who failed to understand
    the danger, and let things go.</p>
<p class="tb">We need not follow the Empire in its downward
    course. We have seen what the work
    of Rome in the world was to be, and how at
    last she accomplished it in spite of constant
    peril and frequent disaster. From Marcus
    Aurelius onwards the strain of self-defence
    was too great to allow of progress in any social
    or political sense. The monarchy became
    more absolute, the machinery of government
    more complicated; the masses were over-taxed,
    and the middle classes ruined. Depopulation
    again set in, and attempts to remedy
    it by settling barbarian invaders within the
    frontiers had some bad results. In less than
    a century from the death of Marcus the
    Empire had been divided into two halves of
    east and west, with a new capital for the
    eastern half at Byzantium (Constantinople).
    This, like all the changes of the later Empire,
    was meant strictly for the purpose of resisting
    the invaders; but, none the less, they broke
    at last through all barriers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>Yet this did not happen before the name
    and fame of Rome had made such deep
    impression on their minds that they sought
    to deserve the inheritance which had thus
    fallen to them; despising, indeed, the degenerate
    provincials who struck no blow in their
    own defence, but full of respect for the majestic
    power which had for so many centuries
    confronted and instructed them.<a class="fn" id="fr_19"
                                      href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_19">[19]</a>
    They never
    swept away the civilisation of the Mediterranean;
    from Julius onwards the Roman
    rulers had done so much to defend it, had
    raised its prestige so high, had so thoroughly
    organised its internal life, that uncivilised
    peoples neither could nor would destroy it.</p>
<p>We still enjoy its best fruits—the art,
    science and literature of Hellas, the genius
    of Rome for law—for “the just interference
    of the State in the interests and passions of
    humanity.”<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_20">[20]</a>
    We may be apt at the present
    day, when science has opened out for us so
    many new paths of knowledge, and inspired
    us with such enthusiasm in pursuing them,
    to forget the value of the inheritance which
    Rome preserved for us. But this is merely a
    <span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
    passing phase of feeling; it is really quite
    inconsistent with the character of an age
    which recognises the doctrine of evolution as
    its great discovery. It is natural to civilised
    man to go back upon his past, and to be grateful
    for all profit he can gain from the study of
    his own development. So we may be certain
    that the claim of Greece and Rome to our
    eternal gratitude will never cease to be asserted,
    and their right to teach us still what
    we could have learnt nowhere else, will never
    be successfully disputed.</p>
