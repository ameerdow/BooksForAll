<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p class="tp"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N this Edition of "<span class="smcap">Songs of the West</span>," some
    considerable
    changes have been made. When the first edition was issued, we had to
    catch the public taste, and to humour it. Accordingly the choruses
    were arranged in four parts, and some of the Songs were set as duets
    and quartettes. But now that real interest in Folk airs has been
    awakened, we have discarded this feature.</p>

<p>Moreover, a good many accompanists complained that the arrangements
    were too elaborate, except for very skilled pianoforte players. We
    have now simplified the settings.</p>

<p>Then, we have omitted twenty-two songs, and have supplied their
    places with others, either because the others are intrinsically
    better, or that they have earlier and more characteristic melodies,
    or again because the songs though sung by the people, did not seem to
    us to have been productions of the folk-muse.</p>

<p>Again, when our first edition was published, modal melodies were not
    appreciated, and we had regretfully to put many aside and introduce
    more of the airs of a modern character. Public taste is a little
    healthier now, and musicians have multiplied who can value these
    early melodies. Consequently we have not felt the same reserve now
    that we did in 1889.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p class="tp"><span class="dropcap">D</span>OROTHY OSBORNE, in a letter to Sir William Temple, in 1653, thus
    describes her daily home life. "The heat of the day is spent in
    reading or working, and about six or seven o'clock I walk out into
    a common that lies hard by the house, where a great many young
    wenches keep sheep or cows, and sit in the shade singing ballads.
    I go to them and compare their voices and beauties to some ancient
    shepherdesses that I have read of, and find a vast difference there;
    but trust me these are as innocent as those could be. I talk to them,
    and find they want nothing to make them the happiest people in the
    world but the knowledge that they are so. Most commonly, when we are
    in the midst of our discourse, one looks about her, and spies her
    cows going into the corn, and then away they all run as if they had
    wings to their heels." ("Letters of Dorothy Osborne," London, 1888,
    p. 103.)</p>

<p>Before that Sir Thomas Overbury, in his "Character of a Milkmaid,"
    had written: "She dares go alone and unfold her sheep in the night,
    and fears no manner of ill, because she means none: yet, to say
    truth, she is never alone, she is still accompanied with old songs,
    honest thoughts, and prayers, but short ones."</p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Mary, the Princess Elizabeth was kept
    under close guard and restraint, but was suffered to walk in the
    palace grounds. "In this situation," says Holinshed, "no marvel if
    she, hearing upon a time, out of her garden at Woodstock, a certain
    milkmaid singing pleasantlie, wished herself to be a milkmaid as she
    was; saying that her case was better, and life merrier." So Viola, in
    Fletcher's play, "The Coxcombe," 1647:</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p><span class="i4">"Would to God, my father</span><br>
            Had lived like one of these, and bred me up<br>
            To milk, and do as they do! Methinks 'tis<br>
            A life that I would chuse, if I were now<br>
            To tell my time again, above a prince's."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The milkmaid, and the girls guarding sheep and cows are things of
    the past, and with them have largely departed their old ballads and
    songs. Tusser, in his "Points on Huswifry," in 1570, recommends the
    country housewife to select her maids from those who sing at their
    work as being usually the most painstaking and the best.</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Such servants are oftenest painsfull and good,<br>
            That sing at their labours, like birds in a wood."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Nowadays, domestic servants sing nothing but hymns, and the use of
    ballads and folksongs has died out among farm girls, and these are
    to be recovered only where there are village industries as basket
    weaving, glove sewing, and the like.</p>

<p>But the old men sing their ancient ditties, or did so till within
    the last fifty years. Now they are no longer called on for them, but
    they remember them, and with a little persuasion can be induced to
    render them up. When I was a boy, I was wont to ride over and about
    Dartmoor, and to put up at little village taverns. There I was sure
    in the evening to hear one or two men sing, and should it be a pay
    day, sing hour after hour, one song following another with little
    intermission.</p>

<p>There was an institution at mines and quarries called a <i>fetching</i>.
    It occurred every fortnight. The men left work early, and went to
    the changing room; stone jars of ale were brought thither from the
    nearest public house. Each man filled his mug, and each in turn,
    before emptying it, was required to sing. On such occasions many a
    fine old ballad was to be picked up. There was also the farm-supper
    after harvest, at which the workmen sang. Now the suppers have been
    discontinued. Ringer's feasts, happily, still remain, and at them a
    good old ditty may be heard. But most of the old singers with their
    traditional ballads set to ancient modal melodies have passed away.</p>

<p>In "Poems, etc.," by Henry Incledon Johns, published by subscription,
    Devonport, 1832, is the following interesting passage. He is
    describing a night spent in an inn on the borders of Dartmoor; he
    met farmers and labourers. "One of the party I observed never took
    any share in the conversation, but appeared to have been invited
    there for the sole purpose of singing to them. He sang a great number
    of ballads, making up in loudness for what he lacked in melody. I
    thought it betrayed rather a want of courtesy that his auditors
    continued to talk while he sang, and no less remarkable, that they
    never expressed either applause or disapprobation of his strains.
    Now and then, one or two of them would join in a line of chorus, but
    it seemed to be done in a sort of parenthesis, and the thread of the
    conversation was immediately resumed as vehemently as ever.... I
    gleaned the following scraps of the border minstrelsy of Dartmoor:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">-vii-</a></span></p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>'There was an old man as blind as blind could be,<br>
            He swore he saw the fox go up a great tree.'</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>'There was one among them all<br>
            That's slender, fair and tall,<br>
            With a black and rolling eye,<br>
            And a skin of lily dye.'</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>'A bonny lass I courted full many a long day,<br>
            And dearly I loved to be in her sweet company.'</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>(The lover then describes the progress of his suit, which proves
    unsuccessful, and concludes thus:—)</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>'Go, dig me a pit, that is long, large, and deep,<br>
            And I'll lay myself down, and take a long sleep.<br>
            <span class="i5">And that's the way to forget her.'</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>"The air to the latter was rather plaintive, and from the lips of
    some siren might have been entitled to an <i>encore</i>, but the voice
    which now gave it utterance only added another to many previous
    proofs that the English are not a musical people. The minstrel was
    in appearance one of the most athletic men I have ever seen, and
    although seventy-five years of age, would still, as I subsequently
    learnt, perform a day's work better than most of the young men of the
    parish. He was a pauper, but in great respect among the neighbouring
    rustics for his vocal powers. His auditory were moor-farmers with
    countenances as rugged and weather-beaten as the rocks among which
    they live."</p>

<p>It is not a little interesting to know that some seventy years after
    this recorded evening we were able to recover two of the songs which
    Mr. Johns gives somewhat inaccurately; and both are included in this
    collection. The first is "<a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_75_THREE_JOVIAL_WELSHMEN">The Three
        Jovial Welshmen</a>," No. 75; and the
    last is "<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_97_THE_FALSE_BRIDE">The False
        Bride</a>," No. 97.</p>

<p>One of my old singers, James Olver, was the son of very strict
    Wesleyans. When he was a boy, he was allowed to hear no music save
    psalm and hymn tunes. But he was wont to creep out of his window at
    night, and start away to the tavern where the miners congregated,
    and listen to and heap up in his memory the songs he there heard. As
    these were forbidden fruit they were all the more dearly prized and
    surely remembered, and when he was a white-haired old man, he poured
    them out to us.</p>

<p>Some forty or fifty years ago, it was customary when the corn was
    cut, for the young men of a parish to agree together, and without
    telling the farmer of their intention, to invade his harvest field,
    work all night and stack his corn, whilst he slept. It was allowed
    to leak out who had done him this favour, and in return, he invited
    them with their lasses to sup and dance and make merry in a lighted
    barn. Then famous old songs were sung. But all that good feeling is
    at an end, and in its place exists a rankling hostility between the
    tiller of the soil and his employer. Blame assuredly attaches to the
    farmer for this condition of affairs, in that he has done away with
    the farmhouse festivities in which workmen and employer took part.</p>

<p>One evening in 1888, I was dining with the late Mr. Daniel Radford,
    of Mount Tavy, when the conversation turned to old Devonshire songs.
    Some of those present knew "<a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_16_WIDDECOMBE_FAIR">Widdecombe Fair</a>,"
    others remembered
    "<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_2_THE_HUNTING_OF_ARSCOTT_OF_TETCOTT">Arscott
        of Tetcott</a>"; and all had heard many and various songs sung
    at Hunt-suppers, at harvest and sheep-shearing feasts. My host turned
    to me and said: "It is a sad thing that our folk-music should perish.
    I wish you would set to work and collect it—gather up the fragments
    that remain before all is lost!"</p>

<p>I undertook the task. I found that it was of little use going to most
    farmers and yeoman. They sang the compositions of Hooke, Hudson, and
    Dibden. But I learned that there were two notable old singing men
    at South Brent, and I was aware that there was one moorland singing
    farmer at Belstone, I was informed of this by J.D. Prickman, Esq., of
    Okehampton. This man, Harry Westaway, knew many old songs. Moreover,
    in my own neighbourhood was a totally illiterate hedger, in fact, he
    could neither read nor write. He enjoyed no little local celebrity
    as a song-man. His name was James Parsons, aged seventy-four, and
    a son of a still more famous singer called "The Singing-machine,"
    and grandson of another of the same fame. In fact, the profession
    of song-man was hereditary in the family. At every country
    entertainment, in olden times, at the public-house almost nightly,
    for more than a century, one of these men of the Parsons' family had
    not failed to attend, to sing as required for the entertainment of
    the company. The <i>repertoire</i> of the grandfather had descended to
    old James. For how many generations before him the profession had
    been followed I could not learn. James Parsons' ballad tunes were
    of an early and archaic character. In fact, with few exceptions his
    melodies were in the Gregorian modes. At one time Parsons and a man
    named Voysey were working on the fringe of Dartmoor, and met in
    the evening at the moorland tavern.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">-viii-</a></span>
    Parsons boasted of the number
    of songs he knew, and Voysey promised to give him a glass of ale
    for every fresh one he sang. Parsons started with "The Outlandish
    Knight," one song streamed forth after another, one glass after
    another was emptied, and these men sat up the whole night, till
    the sun rose, and the song-man's store was not then exhausted, but
    Voysey's pocket was. I could hardly credit this tale when told me, so
    I questioned Voysey, who had worked for my father and was working for
    me. He laughed and confirmed the tale. "I ought to remember it," he
    said, "for he cleared me clean out."</p>

<p>Many a pleasant evening have I spent with old Parsons, he in the
    settle, sitting over the hall fire, I taking down the words of his
    ballads, Mr. Sheppard or Mr. Bussell noting down his melodies.</p>

<p>But one day I heard that an accident had befallen Parsons. In cutting
    "spears," <i>i.e.</i>, pegs for thatching, on his knee he had cut into the
    joint; and the village doctor told me he feared Parsons at his age
    would never get over it. I sent for Mr. Bussell, and said to him: "We
    shall lose our old singer, before we have quite drained him. Come
    with me, and we will visit his cottage, and see what more we can get
    from him." We went, and very pleased he was to sing to us from his
    bed. "<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_30_OLD_WICHET">Old Wichet</a>," No. 30,
    was one of the songs we then acquired from
    him. Happily, the sturdy constitution of the man caused his recovery,
    and he lived on for three years after this accident.</p>

<p>One day in November, I got a letter from the Vicar of South Brent,
    in which he informed me that Robert Hard, a crippled stone-breaker
    there, and one of my song-men, was growing very feeble. Without delay
    I took the train, and arrived at South Brent Vicarage, just as the
    party had finished breakfast. "Now," said I to the Vicar, "Lend me
    your drawing room and the piano, and send for old Hard."</p>

<p>The stone breaker arrived, and I spent almost the whole day, that is,
    till the dusk of evening fell, taking down his songs and melodies.
    From him then, I had "The Cuckoo," that I have published in my
    "Garland of Country Songs." A month later, poor old Hard was found
    dead in a snowdrift by the roadside.</p>

<p>I had enlisted the services of such excellent musicians as the late
    Rev. H. Fleetwood Sheppard, of Thurnscoe, Yorkshire, and Mr., now
    the Rev. Doctor Bussell, Mus. Doc., and Vice-principal of <span class="err" title="Brasenose">Brazennose</span>
    College, Oxford, and we worked at
    collecting, at South Brent, where besides Robert Hard, was John
    Helmore, a miller, who died in the Ivy Bridge Workhouse in 1900;
    also at Belstone, and we worked through the length and breadth of
    Dartmoor. James Coaker,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> a
    blind man of 89, in the heart of the
    moor, very infirm, and able to leave his bed for a few hours of the
    day only, was unable to sing, but could recite the words of ballads;
    but Mr. J. Webb, captain of a mine hard by, knew his tunes, and could
    very sweetly pipe them. On Blackdown, Mary Tavy, lived a mason,
    Samuel Fone, he died in 1898. He had an almost inexhaustible supply.
    Further songs were yielded by a singing blacksmith, John Woodrich, of
    Woolacott Moor, Thrushleton, commonly known as "Ginger Jack"; also
    by Roger Luxton, of Halwell, by James Olver, Tanner, Launceston, a
    native of S. Kewe, Cornwall; by John Masters, of Bradstone, aged
    83; by William Rice and John Rickards, both of Lamerton; by William
    Friend, labourer, Lydford; Edmund Fry, thatcher, a native of Lezant,
    Cornwall; Roger Hannaford, Widdecombe; Will and Roger Huggins,
    Lydford; W. Bickle, Bridestowe; Matthew Baker, a poor cripple, Lew
    Down; John Dingle, Coryton; J. Peake, tanner, Liskeard; and Mr. S.
    Gilbert, the aged innkeeper of the "Falcon," Mawgan, in Pyder. More
    were obtained from old singers at Two Bridges and Post Bridge on
    Dartmoor, from others at Chagford, at Holne, and at South Brent. From
    others again at Menheniot, Cornwall, and at Fowey. Some songs taken
    down from moor men on Dartmoor, in or about 1868, were sent me by
    W. Crossing, Esq., who knows Dartmoor better than any man living;
    others by T.S. Cayzer, Esq., taken down in 1849. Miss Bidder, of
    Stoke Flemming, most kindly searched her neighbourhood for old women
    who knew ancient songs, and sent me what she obtained. We had several
    rare old melodies from Sally Satterley,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> now
    dead, of Huccaby
    Bridge, Dartmoor. She had acquired them from her father, a crippled
    fiddler.</p>

<p>Of the vast quantities of tunes that we have collected, perhaps a
    third are very good, a third are good, and the remainder indifferent.
    The singers are almost invariably illiterate and aged, and when they
    die the tradition will be lost, for the present generation will
    have nothing to do with these songs, especially such as are modal,
    and supplant them with the vulgarest music hall compositions. The
    melodies are far more precious than the words, and we have been
    more concerned to rescue these than the words, which are often
    common-place, and may frequently be found on broadside ballad sheets.
    The words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">-ix-</a></span> are less frequently of home growth
    than the airs, and over
    and over again we came upon ballads already in print, but not to the
    tunes to which they are sung elsewhere. There are, in fact, only a
    few, such as "Cupid's Garden," "Bold General Wolf," "Lord Thomas and
    the Fair Eleanor," "Barbara Allen," "Outward Bound," "The Mermaid,"
    that retain the melodies to which sung in other parts of England.
    But, "<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_95_TOBACCO_IS_AN_INDIAN_WEED">Tobacco is
        an Indian Weed</a>," "Joans' Ale is New," "<a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_55_THE_FOX">The Fox</a>," and
    many others have tunes to which sung in Devon and Cornwall that are
    quite different and local. A remarkable instance is that of "<a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_15_SWEET_NIGHTINGALE">Sweet
        Nightingale</a>." This appeared in 1761 with music by Dr. Arne. The words
    travelled down to Cornwall, not so Arne's tune, and they were there
    set to an entirely independent melody. Then again, when a tune did
    travel West, and was heard by some of the peasant singers, if it did
    not commend itself to their taste, they altered it, perhaps quite
    unconsciously into a form more satisfactory to their minds. I have
    given a very curious example of this, "<a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_3_UPON_A_SUNDAY_MORNING">Upon a Sunday
        Morning</a>."</p>

<p>Our folk music is a veritable moraine of rolled and ground fragments
    from musical strata far away. It contains melodies of all centuries
    from the days of the minstrels down to the present time, all thrown
    together in one heap. It must be borne well in mind that to the
    rustic singer, melody is everything. It was so in the days before
    Elizabeth. The people then did not want harmony; to them harmony is
    quite a modern invention and need.</p>

<p>At the present day, we are so accustomed to choral and concerted
    music that we have come to care little for formal melody, and Wagner
    has taught us to be content with musical phrases alone. Melody is
    a musical idea worked out in successive notes of our scale. Modern
    music is constructed in but two of the seven diatonic modes, in which
    melodies may be cast, the major and the minor; with the result that
    the modern ear entertains no appreciation of an air that is not in
    the Ionian scale, the "tonus lascivus" of the ancients.</p>

<p>The jongleur or minstrel had but the rudest of instruments; the
    peasant singer had none at all. What interest he can create, what
    effect he can produce, must be through melody alone. Now, I venture
    to assert that the folk music of the English peasantry has been
    surpassingly rich in melodiousness, and that no tune has had a chance
    of living and being transmitted from generation to generation,
    unless it have a distinct individuality in it, in a word, contains
    a melodious idea. Moreover, not having been framed only in the
    common major or minor key, it is abundantly varied. It has been a
    well-spring from which hitherto we have not drawn.</p>

<p>In former times, that strongly defined dividing line which separates
    the cultured from the uncultured did not exist. The music of
    the peasant was also the music of the court; the ballad was the
    delight of the cottager and of the noble lady in her bower. But the
    separation began, in music, in the Elizabethan days; in ballads,
    in those of James I., when nearly every old ballad was re-written
    to fresh metres, unsingable to the traditional airs. The skilled
    musician scorned folk melodies, and revelled in counter-point.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that all mediæval music was in the
    Gregorian modes other than our major and minor. Even in the 13th
    century, the modern major mode was used, so that some of our
    traditional airs, which seem to be modern may really be old.</p>

<p>M. Tiersot notes that among the melodies extant of three trouvères of
    the Thirteenth century, a certain number are modern in character. Of
    twenty-two airs by the Chatelain de Coucy, three are frankly in the
    major; five others in the 7th or the 8th tone, give the impression of
    the major. Of nine melodies by the King of Navarre, four are in the
    major, a fifth in the 7th tone, is of the same nature as those of De
    Coucy. Of thirty-four <i>chansons</i> by Adam de la Hall, twenty-one are
    in the major.</p>

<p>The folk airs that we give in our collection may not please at
    first, certainly will not please all; but when once a relish for
    them has been acquired, then hearers will turn with weariness from
    the ordinary concert hall feebleness, as we turn from the twaddle of
    a vacuous female. We have found it necessary to take down all the
    variants of the same air that we have come across.</p>

<p>M. Bourgault Ducoudray, in his introduction to "Mélodies populaires
    de Basse Bretagne," Paris, 1885, says: "When a song has been
    transmitted from mouth to mouth, without having been fixed by
    notation, it is exposed to alterations. One is sometimes obliged to
    collect as many as twenty variants of the same air, before finding
    one that is good. This is the greatest difficulty to the seeker; it
    is as hard to lay the hand on the veritable typal form of a melody
    as it is to meet with an intact specimen among the shells that have
    been rolled on the sea shore." When a party of singers is assembled,
    or when one man sings a succession of ballads, the memory becomes
    troubled; the first few melodies are given correctly, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">-x-</a></span>
    after
    that, the airs become deflected and influenced by the airs last sung.
    At Two Bridges one old singer, G. Kerswell, after giving us "The
    Bell-ringers," sang us half-a-dozen ballads but the melody of the
    bells went through them all, and vitiated them all so as to render
    them worthless. On another occasion, we took down four or five airs
    all beginning alike, because one singer had impressed this beginning
    on the minds of the others. At another time, when this impression was
    worn off, they would sing correctly, and then the beginnings would be
    different. Experience taught us never to take down too much at one
    sitting.</p>

<p>In a very few years all this heritage of traditional folk music will
    be gone; and this is the supreme moment at which such a collection
    can be made. Already, nearly every one of my old singers from
    whom these melodies were gathered, is dead. They are passing away
    everywhere. Few counties of England have been worked. Sussex has
    been well explored by the late Rev. John Broadwood, and then by Miss
    Lucy Broadwood<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>;
    Yorkshire, by Mr. Frank Kidson; Northumberland,
    by Dr. Collingwood Bruce and Mr. John Stokoe. Mr. Cecil Sharp is now
    engaged on Somersetshire, and Dr. Vaughan Williams on Essex. Who will
    undertake Lincolnshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and other counties? The
    purely agricultural districts are most auriferous. In manufacturing
    counties modern music has driven out the traditional folk melodies.</p>

<p>With regard to the approximate dates of the airs we give, all that
    we can say is that such as are in the ancient modes are not later
    than the reign of James I. How much more ancient they may be, it is
    impossible to determine. The melodies of the Handel and Arne, and
    then those of the Hooke and Dibden periods can be at once detected.
    Some few of the melodies we have taken down were certainly originally
    in one or other of the ancient modes, but in process of time have
    been subjected to alteration, to accommodate them to the modern ear.</p>

<p>Although some seventy per cent. of the airs noted from the very
    old singers are modal, we have not given too many of these, as the
    popular taste is not sufficiently educated to relish them. But such
    as can not perceive the beauty of the tunes that go, for instance,
    to "<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_4_THE_TREES_THEY_ARE_SO_HIGH">The Trees
        they are so high</a>," in the rarely used Phrygian mode,
    "<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_58_FLORA_THE_LILY_OF_THE_WEST">Flora, the
        Flower of the West</a>," in F, "<a

        morning so early</a>," etc., are indeed to be pitied. We have not been
    able to give those lengthy ballads, such as, "The Outlandish Knight,"
    "The Brown Girl," "By the Banks of Green Willow," "The Baffled
    Knight," "William and the Shepherd's Daughter," "Captain Ward," "The
    Golden Glove," "The Maid and the Box," "The Death of Queen Jane,"
    etc., which are too long to be sung and listened to with patience
    now-a-days.</p>

<p>In some instances we have set other words to a ballad tune, as <a
        href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_36_A_SWEET_PRETTY_MAIDEN_SAT_UNDER_A_TREE">XXXVI</a>.
    One of my old singers said to me concerning this ballad, "When my
    little sister, now dead, these twenty years, was a child, and went up
    from Exeter to London with me in a carrier's van, Lor bless'y, afore
    railways was invented, I mind that she sang this here ballet in the
    waggon all the way up. We was three days about it. She was then about
    six years old." The ballet, by the way, is not particularly choice
    and suitable for a child or a grown-up girl to sing, according to our
    ideas.</p>

<p>In giving these songs to the public, we have been scrupulous to
    publish the airs precisely as noted down, choosing among the
    variants those which commended themselves to us as the soundest.
    But we have not been so careful with regard to the <i>words</i>. These
    are sometimes in a fragmentary condition, or are coarse, contain
    <i>double entendres</i>, or else are mere doggerel. Accordingly, we have
    re-written the songs wherever it was not possible to present them
    in their original form. This was done by the Scotch. Many an old
    ballad is gross, and many a broadside is common-place. Songs that
    were thought witty in the Caroline and early Georgian epochs, are no
    longer sufferable; and broadside ballads are in many cases vulgarised
    versions of earlier ballads that have been lost in their original
    forms.</p>

<p>What a change has taken place in public feeling with regard to
    decency may be judged by the way in which Addison speaks of D'Urfey
    in "The Guardian," 1713, No. 29. "A <i>judicious</i> author, some years
    since, published a collection of sonnets, which he very successfully
    called "Laugh and be Fat; or, Pills to purge Melancholy." I can
    not sufficiently admire the facetious title of these volumes, and
    must censure the world of ingratitude, while they are so negligent
    in rewarding the jocose labours of my friend, Mr. D'Urfey, who was
    so large a contributor to this treatise, and to whose numerous
    productions so many rural squires in the remotest parts of the
    island are obliged for the dignity and state which corpulency gives
    them." And again, in No. 67, "I must heartily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">-xi-</a></span>
    recommend to all
    young ladies, my disciples, the case of my old friend, who has often
    made their grand-mothers merry, and whose sonnets have perhaps
    lulled to sleep many a present toast, when she lay in her cradle."
    Why—D'Urfey's Pills must now-a-days be kept under lock and key. The
    fun so commended by the pious and grave Addison is filth of the most
    revolting description. And yet the grand-mothers of the ladies of his
    day, according to him, were wont to sing them over the cradles of
    their grand-children!</p>

<p>So when a "Collection of Old Ballads" was published 1723-5, the
    Editor, after giving a series of historical and serious pieces, in
    a later volume apologises to the ladies for their gravity, and for
    their special delectation furnishes an appendix of songs that are
    simply dirty.</p>

<p>A good many of the ditties in favour with our rural song-men, are,
    it must be admitted, of the D'Urfey type; and what is more some of
    the very worst are sung to the daintiest early melodies. Two courses
    lay open to us. One that adopted Dr. Barrett and Mr. Kidson to print
    the words exactly as given on the broadsides, with asterisks for the
    undesirable stanzas. But this would simply have killed the songs.
    No one would care to warble what was fragmentary. On the other
    hand, there is that adopted by the Scotch and Irish collectors,
    which consists in re-writing or modifying where objectionable or
    common-place. This has been the course we have pursued. It seemed a
    pity to consign the lovely old melodies to the antiquary's library,
    by publishing them with words which were fatal to the success of the
    songs in the drawing room or the concert hall. We resolved where the
    old words were good, or tolerable, to retain them. Where bad, to
    re-write, adhering as closely as possible to the original. Where the
    songs were mere broadside ballads, we have had no scruple in doing
    this, for we give reference to the press-mark in the British Museum,
    where the original text may be found. But the broadside itself is
    often a debased form of a fine early ballad. The broadside publishers
    were wont to pay a shilling to any ballad mongers who could furnish
    them with a new ditty. These men were destitute of the poetic faculty
    and illiterate, and they contented themselves with taking old ballads
    and recomposing them, so as to give to them a semblance of novelty,
    sufficient to qualify their authors to claim the usual fee. Here are
    some lines by one of the fraternity:</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">

        <p>"I'm Billy Nuts wot always cuts<br>
            <span class="i1">A dash through all the town, sir,</span><br>
            With lit'rary men, my clever pen<br>
            <span class="i1">In grammar gains renown, sir,</span><br>
            In song, and catch, and ditty.<br>

            <span class="i9">(B.M., 11,621, K. 4)</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Our object was not to furnish a volume for consultation by the
    musical antiquary alone, but to resuscitate, and to popularise
    the traditional music of the English people. As, however, to the
    antiquary everything is important, exactly as obtained, uncleansed
    from rust and unpolished, I have deposited a copy of the songs and
    ballads with their music exactly as taken down, for reference, in the
    Municipal Free Library, Plymouth.</p>

<p>The Rev. H.F. Sheppard, who worked with me for twelve years in
    rescuing these old songs, and in bringing them before the public,
    is now no more. A new edition has been called for, and in this
    some exclusions and some additions have been made. We do not think
    that the pieces we have removed are not good, but that we are able
    to supply their places with others that are better. Mr. Sheppard
    entertained a very strong objection to arranging any song he had
    not himself "pricked down" from the lips of the singers, and as Mr.
    Bussell had noted down hundreds as well, these, for the most part,
    had to be laid on one side. Mr. Sheppard was, doubtless, right in his
    assertion, that unless he had himself heard the song sung, he could
    not catch its special character, and so render it justly.</p>

<p>Acting on the advice of Mr. Cecil Sharp, of the Conservatoire,
    Hampstead, who has kindly undertaken the musical editorship of this
    edition, I have introduced several interesting ballads and songs
    that, for the reason above given, were excluded from the first. Mr.
    F. Kidson has kindly afforded us information relative to such songs
    as he has come across in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>In conclusion I give a few particulars relative to the Rev. H.F.
    Sheppard, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">-xii-</a></span> fellow-worker, and Mr. D.
    Radford, the instigator of
    the collection, both of whom have passed away.</p>

<p>Henry Fleetwood Sheppard was a graduate of Trinity Hall, Cambridge,
    and had been appointed Travelling Batchelor to the University.
    Through the whole of his clerical career he was closely associated
    with sacred music, especially with Plain-song, of which he was an
    enthusiastic admirer. As precentor of the Doncaster Choral Union
    from 1864 to 1884, he became the pioneer of improved church music
    in that part of Yorkshire. In the year 1868 he was presented to the
    Rectory of Thurnscoe, which at that time was an agricultural village
    numbering about 180 inhabitants, where he remained until 1898, when
    he resigned his living on account of his advancing years which
    precluded his coping satisfactorily with the population swelling to
    3,366 souls, owing to the opening of coal mines in the parish. In
    1888, as already intimated, he was associated along with myself in
    the collection of Devon and Cornish folk songs.</p>

<p>When he resigned the incumbency of Thurnscoe, he retired to Oxford,
    where, in his declining years, he might, at his leisure, dip into
    those store houses of classical and musical literature in which his
    soul delighted.</p>

<p>Three days before Christmas, 1901, a slight stroke of paralysis gave
    warning of possibly serious mischief. A sudden and fatal collapse
    ensued on S. John's Day, without further warning. He was laid to rest
    at Oxford on New Year's Eve. An inscription in the Vestry wall at
    Thurnscoe, was cut by one who was in Mr. Sheppard's choir for nearly
    forty years before his death. "Pray for the peace of Henry Fleetwood
    Sheppard, Rector of this Parish Church, 1868-1898, who went to rest,
    December 27th, 1901, aged 77 years."</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Radford, of Mount Tavy, was an enthusiastic lover of all
    that pertained to his county. He knew that a number of traditional
    songs and ballads still floated about, and he saw clearly that unless
    these were at once collected, they would be lost irretrievably, and
    he pressed on me the advisability of making a collection, and of
    setting about it at once. I began to do so in 1888, and continued
    at it, working hard for twelve years, assisted by Mr. Sheppard and
    Mr. Bussell. Mr. Radford was one for whom I entertained the deepest
    affection, inspired by his high character; and I knew that what he
    judged to be advisable should be undertaken in no perfunctory way.</p>

<p>Mr. Radford died January 3rd, 1900, at the age of seventy-two, and
    was buried in Lydford churchyard. The beautiful rood-screen in the
    church has been erected by his sons to his memory.</p>

<p>In the collection, the music initialed H.F.S. has the accompaniment
    arranged for the piano by Mr. Sheppard, that initialed C.J.S. by Mr.
    C.J. Sharp; that F.W.B. by Dr. Bussell.</p>

        <p>In the month of November, in the year fifty-two,<br>
            Three jolly Fox-hunters, all Sons of the Blue,<br>
            They rode from Pencarrow, not fearing a wet coat,<br>

            He blew such a flourish, so loud in the hall,<br>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>They tried in the coppice, from Becket to Thorn,<br>
            There were Ringwood and Rally, and Princess and Scorn;<br>
            Then out bounded Reynard, away they all went,<br>
            With the wind in their tails, on a beautiful scent.<br>
            <span class="i3">Sing fol-de-rol, &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>"Hark, Vulcan!" said Arscott, "The best of good hounds!<br>
            Heigh Venus!" he shouted, "How nimbly she bounds!<br>
            And nothing re-echoes so sweet in the valley,<br>
            As the music of Rattler, of Fill-pot, and Rally."<br>
            <span class="i3">Sing fol-de-rol, &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>They hunted o'er fallow, o'er field and on moor,<br>
            And never a hound, man or horse would give o'er.<br>
            Sly Reynard kept distance for many a mile,<br>
            And no one dismounted for gate or for stile.<br>
            <span class="i3">Sing fol-de-rol, &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>"How far do you make it?" said Simon, the Son,<br>
            "The day that's declining will shortly be done."<br>
            "We'll follow till Doom's day," quoth Arscott. Before<br>
            They hear the Atlantic with menacing roar.<br>
            <span class="i3">Sing fol-de-rol, &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">8</p>

        <p>Thro' Whitstone and Poundstock, St. Gennys they run,<br>
            As a fireball, red, in the sea set the sun.<br>
            Then out on Penkenner—a leap, and they go,<br>
            Full five hundred feet to the ocean be-low.<br>
            <span class="i3">Sing fol-de-rol, &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">9</p>

        <p>When the full moon is shining as clear as the day,<br>
            John Arscott still hunteth the country, they say;<br>
            You may see him on Black-Bird, and hear, in full cry<br>
            The pack from Pencarrow to Dazard go by.<br>
            <span class="i3">Sing fol-de-rol, &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">10</p>

        <p>When the tempest is howling, his horn you may hear,<br>
            And the bay of his hounds in their headlong career;<br>
            For Arscott of Tetcott loves hunting so well,<br>
            That he breaks for the pastime from Heaven—or Hell.<br>
            <span class="i3">Sing fol-de-rol, &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p><span class="i2">Upon a Sunday morning, when Spring was in its prime,</span><br>
            Along the Church-lane tripping, I heard the Church-bells chime,<br>
            <span class="i2">And there encountered Reuben, astride upon the stile,</span><br>
            He blocked the way, so saucy, upon his lips a smile.</p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p><span class="i2">Upon a Sunday morning, there came a rush of bells,</span><br>
            The wind was music-laden, in changeful fall and swells;<br>
            <span class="i2">He would not let me over, he held, he made me stay,</span><br>
            And promise I would meet him again at close of day.</p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p><span class="i2">Upon a Sunday evening, the ringers in the tower,</span><br>
            Were practising their changes, they rang for full an hour;<br>
            <span class="i2">And Reuben by me walking, would never let me go,</span><br>
            Until a Yes I answered, he would not take a No.</p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p><span class="i2">Again a Sunday morning, and Reuben stands by me,</span><br>
            Not now in lane, but chancel, where all the folks may see.<br>
            <span class="i2">A golden ring he offers, as to his side I cling,</span><br>
            O happy Sunday morning, for us the Church-bells ring.</p>

        <p>All the trees they are so high,<br>
            <span class="i1">The leaves they are so green,</span><br>
            The day is past and gone, sweet-heart,<br>
            <span class="i1">That you and I have seen.</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">It is cold winter's night,</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">You and I must bide alone:</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Whilst my pretty lad is young</span><br>
            <span class="i9">And is growing.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>In a garden as I walked,<br>
            <span class="i1">I heard them laugh and call;</span><br>
            There were four and twenty playing there,<br>
            <span class="i1">They played with bat and ball.</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">O the rain on the roof,</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Here and I must make my moan:</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Whilst my pretty lad is young</span><br>
            <span class="i9">And is growing.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>I listened in the garden,<br>
            <span class="i1">I looked o'er the wall;</span><br>
            Amidst five and twenty gallants there<br>
            <span class="i1">My love exceeded all.</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">O the wind on the thatch,</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Here and I alone must weep:</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Whilst my pretty lad is young</span><br>

            <span class="i1">Great wrong to me is done,</span><br>
            That I should married be this day,<br>

            <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">At the huffle of the gale,</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Here I toss and cannot sleep:</span><br>

        <p>To let the lovely ladies know<br>
            <span class="i1">They may not touch and taste,</span><br>
            I'll bind a bunch of ribbons red<br>
            <span class="i1">About his little waist.</span><br>

        <p>I married was, alas,<br>
            <span class="i1">A lady high to be,</span><br>
            In court and stall and stately hall,<br>
            <span class="i1">And bower of tapestry,</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">But the bell did only knell,</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And I shuddered as one cold:</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">When I wed the pretty lad</span><br>
            <span class="i8">Not done growing.</span></p>

        <p class="center">8</p>

        <p>At seventeen he wedded was,<br>
            <span class="i1">A father at eighteen,</span><br>
            At nineteen his face was white as milk,<br>
            <span class="i1">And then his grave was green;</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And the daisies were outspread,</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And buttercups of gold,</span><br>
            <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">O'er my pretty lad so young</span><br>
            <span class="i8">Now ceased growing.</span></p>

            A single life, perforce he led,<br>

            The very first love that ever I had,<br>

        <p>A twelvemonth and a day being up,<br>
            <span class="i1">The ghost began to speak;</span><br>
            "Why sit you here by my grave-side<br>
            <span class="i1">From dusk till dawning break?"</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>"O think upon the garden, love,<br>
            <span class="i1">Where you and I did walk.</span><br>
            The fairest flower that blossomed there<br>
            <span class="i1">Is withered on its stalk."</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>"What is it that you want of me,<br>

            Your salten tears they trickle down<br>
            <span class="i1">My winding sheet to steep."</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>"Oh I will now redeem the pledge<br>
            <span class="i1">The pledge that once I gave;</span><br>
            A kiss from off thy lily white lips<br>
            <span class="i1">Is all of you I crave."</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>"Cold are my lips in death, sweet-heart,<br>

            If you do touch my clay-cold lips,<br>
            <span class="i1">Your time will not be long."</span></p>

        <p class="center">8</p>

        <p>Then through the mould he heaved his head,<br>
            <span class="i1">And through the herbage green.</span><br>
            There fell a frosted bramble leaf,<br>
            <span class="i1">It came their lips between.</span></p>

        <p class="center">9</p>

        <p>"Now if you were not true in word,<br>

        <p>In my garden grew plenty of Thyme,<br>
            <span class="i2">It would flourish by night and by day;</span><br>
            O'er the wall came a lad, he took all that I had,<br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>Young Jack he was a journey-man<br>
            <span class="i1">That roved from town to town,</span><br>
            And when he'd done a job of work,<br>
            <span class="i1">He lightly sat him down.</span><br>
            With his kit upon his shoulder, and<br>
            <span class="i1">A grafting knife in hand,</span><br>
            He roved the country round about,<br>
            <span class="i1">A merry journey-man.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>And when he came to Exeter,<br>
            <span class="i1">The maidens leaped for joy;</span><br>
            Said one and all, both short and tall,<br>
            <span class="i1">Here comes a gallant boy.</span><br>
            The lady dropt her needle, and<br>
            <span class="i1">The maid her frying-pan,</span><br>
            Each plainly told her mother, that<br>
            <span class="i1">She loved the journey-man.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>He had not been in Exeter,<br>
            <span class="i1">The days were barely three,</span><br>
            Before the Mayor, his sweet daughter.<br>
            <span class="i1">She loved him desperately;</span><br>
            She bid him to her mother's house,<br>
            <span class="i1">She took him by the hand,</span><br>
            Said she, "My dearest mother, see<br>
            <span class="i1">I love the journey-man!"</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>Now out on thee, thou silly maid!<br>
            <span class="i1">Such folly speak no more:</span><br>
            How can'st thou love a roving man,<br>
            <span class="i1">Thou ne'er hast seen before?</span><br>
            "O mother sweet, I do entreat,<br>
            <span class="i1">I love him all I can;</span><br>
            Around the country glad I'll rove<br>
            <span class="i1">With this young journey-man.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>"He need no more to trudge afoot,<br>
            <span class="i1">He'll travel coach and pair;</span><br>
            My wealth with me—or poverty<br>
            <span class="i1">With him, content I'll share."</span><br>
            Now fill the horn with barleycorn,<br>
            <span class="i1">And flowing fill the can:</span><br>
            Here let us toast the Mayor's daughter<br>
            <span class="i1">And the roving journey-man.</span><br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>All ye that love to hear<br>
            Music performed in air,<br>
            Pray listen, and give ear,<br>
            <span class="i3">To what I shall perpend.</span><br>
            Concerning music, who'd,—<br>
            If rightly understood—<br>
            Not find 'twould do him good<br>
            <span class="i3">To hearken and attend.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>In Brixham town so rare<br>
            For singing sweet and fair,<br>
            Few can with us compare,<br>
            <span class="i3">We bear away the bell.</span><br>
            Extolled up and down<br>
            By men of high renown,<br>
            We go from town to town;<br>
            <span class="i3">And none can us excell.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>There's a man in Brixham town<br>
            Of office, and in gown,<br>
            Strove to put singing down,<br>
            <span class="i3">Which most of men adore.</span><br>
            For House of God unmeet,<br>
            The voice and organ sweet!<br>
            When pious men do meet,<br>
            <span class="i3">To praise their God before.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>Go question Holy writ,<br>
            And you will find in it,<br>
            That seemly 'tis and fit,<br>
            <span class="i3">To praise and hymn the Lord.</span><br>
            On cymbal and on lute,<br>
            On organ and on flute,<br>
            With voices sweet, that suit;<br>
            <span class="i3">All in a fair concord.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>In Samuel you may read<br>
            How one was troubled,<br>
            Was troubled indeed,<br>
            <span class="i3">Who crown and sceptre bore;</span><br>
            An evil spirit lay<br>
            On his mind both night and day,<br>
            That would not go away,<br>
            <span class="i3">And vexed him very sore.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>Then up and uttered one,<br>
            Said, "Jesse hath a son,<br>
            Of singers next to none;<br>
            <span class="i3">David his name they say."</span><br>
            "So send for David, fleet,<br>
            To make me music sweet,<br>
            That the spirit may retreat,<br>
            <span class="i3">And go from me away."</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>Now when that David, he<br>
            King Saul had come to see,<br>
            And playèd merrily.<br>
            <span class="i3">Upon his stringèd harp,</span><br>
            The Devil in all speed,<br>
            With music ill agreed,<br>
            From Saul the King, he fleed,<br>
            <span class="i3">Impatient to depart.</span></p>

        <p class="center">8</p>

        <p>Now there be creatures three<br>
            As you may plainly see<br>
            With music can't agree<br>
            <span class="i3">Upon this very earth</span><br>
            The swine, the fool, the ass,<br>
            And so we let it pass<br>
            And sing, O Lord, thy praise<br>
            <span class="i3">Whilst we have breath.</span></p>

        <p class="center">9</p>

        <p>So now, my friends, adieu!<br>
            I hope that all of you<br>
            Will pull most strong and true,<br>
            <span class="i3">In strain to serve the Lord.</span><br>
            God prosper us, that we<br>
            Like angels may agree,<br>
            In singing merrily<br>
            <span class="i3">In tune and in accord.</span></p>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>There was an old man lived out in the wood,<br>
            <span class="i1">His trade was a-cutting of Broom, green Broom;</span><br>
            He had but one son without thrift, without good,<br>
            <span class="i1">Who lay in his bed till 'twas noon, bright noon.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>The old man awoke, one morning and spoke,<br>
            <span class="i1">He swore he would fire the room, that room,</span><br>
            If his John would not rise and open his eyes,<br>
            <span class="i1">And away to the wood to cut Broom, green Broom.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>So Johnny arose, and he slipped on his clothes,<br>
            <span class="i1">And away to the wood to cut Broom, green Broom,</span><br>
            He sharpened his knives, for once he contrives<br>
            <span class="i1">To cut a great bundle of Broom, green Broom.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>When Johnny passed under a lady's fine house,<br>
            <span class="i1">Passed under a lady's fine room, fine room,</span><br>
            She called to her maid, "Go fetch me," she said,<br>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>When Johnny came into the lady's fine house,<br>

            "Young Johnny," she said, "Will you give up your trade,<br>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>Johnny gave his consent, and to church they both went,<br>
            <span class="i1">And he wedded the lady in bloom, full bloom.</span><br>
            At market and fair, all folks do declare,<br>

        <p>As Johnny walked out one day<br>
            <span class="i1">It was a summer morn,</span><br>
            Himself he laid beneath the shade<br>
            <span class="i1">All of a twisted thorn,</span><br>
            And as he there lay lazily<br>
            <span class="i1">A shepherdess pass'd by;</span><br>
            And 'twas down in yonder valley, love,<br>
            <span class="i1">Where the water glideth by.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>"O have you seen a pretty ewe<br>
            <span class="i1">That hath a tender lamb,</span><br>
            A strayed from the orchard glade<br>
            <span class="i1">That little one and dam?"</span><br>
            "O pretty maid" he answered,<br>
            <span class="i1">"They passed as here I lie!"</span><br>
            And 'twas down in yonder valley, love,<br>
            <span class="i1">Where the water glideth by.</span></p>

        </p>

        <p>She wandered o'er the country wide<br>
            <span class="i1">The sheep she could not find;</span><br>
            And many times she did upbraid<br>
            <span class="i1">Young Johnny in her mind.</span><br>
            She sought in leafy forest green<br>
            <span class="i1">She sought them low and high,</span><br>
            And 'twas down in yonder valley, love,<br>
            <span class="i1">Where the water glideth by.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>"Oh silly maid," young Johnny said,<br>
            <span class="i1">"Alone why did you seek?"</span><br>
            Her heart was full of anger, and<br>
            <span class="i1">The flush was in her cheek.</span><br>
            "Where one alone availeth not,<br>
            <span class="i1">There two your sheep may spie,</span><br>
            And 'tis down in yonder valley, love,<br>
            <span class="i1">Where the water glideth by."</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>vThen lo! they both forgot their quest,<br>
            <span class="i1">They found what neither sought,</span><br>
            Two loving hearts long kept apart<br>
            <span class="i1">Together now were brought.</span><br>
            He found the words he long had lacked,<br>
            <span class="i1">He found and held her eye;</span><br>
            And 'twas down in yonder valley, love,<br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>There was a miller, as you shall hear,<br>
            Long time he lived in Devonshire,<br>
            He was took sick and deadly ill,<br>
            And had no time to write his will!<br>
            He was took sick and deadly ill,<br>
            And had no time to write his will.</p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>So he call'd up his eldest son,<br>
            Said he, "My glass is almost run.<br>
            If I to thee my mill shall give,<br>
            Tell me what toll thou'lt take to live?"</p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>"Father," said he, "My name is Jack,<br>
            From every bushel I'll take a peck.<br>
            From every grist that I do grind,<br>
            That I may thus good living find."</p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>"Thou art a fool," the old man said,<br>
            "Thou hast not half acquired thy trade.<br>
            My mill to thee I ne'er will give<br>
            For by such toll no man can live."</p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>Then he call'd up his second son,<br>
            Said he, "My glass is almost run.<br>
            If I to thee my mill shall make,<br>
            Tell me what toll to live thou'lt take?"</p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>"Father you know my name is Ralph,<br>
            From every bushel I'll take a half<br>
            From every grist that I do grind,<br>
            That I may thus a living find."</p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>"Thou art a fool," the old man said;<br>
            "Thou hast not half acquired thy trade.<br>
            My mill to thee I will not give,<br>
            For by such toll no man may live."</p>

        <p class="center">8</p>

        <p>Then he call'd up his youngest son,<br>
            Says he, "My glass is almost run.<br>
            If I to thee my mill shall make<br>
            Tell me what toll, to live, thou'lt take?"</p>

        <p class="center">9</p>

        <p>"Father I am your youngest boy.<br>
            In taking toll is all my joy.<br>
            Before I would good living lack,<br>
            I'd take the whole—forswear the sack."</p>

        <p class="center">10</p>

        <p>"Thou art the boy," the old man said,<br>
            "For thou hast full acquired the trade.<br>
            The mill is thine," the old man cried,<br>
            He laugh'd, gave up the ghost, and died.</p>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>There came three men from out the West<br>
            <span class="i1">Their victory to try;</span><br>
            And they have ta'en a solemn oath,<br>
            <span class="i1">Poor Barleycorn should die.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">With a Ri-fol-lol-riddle-diddle-dol</span><br>
            <span class="i4">Ri fol, ri fol dee.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>They took a plough and ploughed him in,<br>
            <span class="i1">Clods harrowed on his head;</span><br>
            And then they took a solemn oath<br>
            <span class="i1">John Barleycorn was dead.</span><br>
            <span class="i4">With a Ri-fol &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>There he lay sleeping in the ground<br>
            <span class="i1">Till rain did on him fall;</span><br>
            Then Barleycorn sprung up his head,<br>
            <span class="i1">And so amazed them all.</span><br>
            <span class="i4">With a Ri-fol &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>There he remained till Midsummer<br>
            <span class="i1">And look'd both pale and wan;</span><br>
            Then Barleycorn he got a beard<br>
            <span class="i1">And so became a man.</span><br>
            <span class="i4">With a Ri-fol &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>Then they sent men with scythes so sharp<br>
            <span class="i1">To cut him off at knee;</span><br>
            And then poor Johnny Barleycorn<br>
            <span class="i1">They served most barbarouslie.</span><br>
            <span class="i4">With a Ri-fol &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>Then they sent men with pitch forks strong<br>
            <span class="i1">To pierce him through the heart;</span><br>
            And like a doleful Tragedy<br>
            <span class="i1">They bound him in a cart.</span><br>
            <span class="i4">With a Ri-fol &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>And then they brought him to a barn<br>
            <span class="i1">A prisoner to endure;</span><br>
            And so they fetched him out again,<br>
            <span class="i1">And laid him on the floor.</span><br>
            <span class="i4">With a Ri-fol &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">8</p>

        <p>Then they set men with holly clubs,<br>
            <span class="i1">To beat the flesh from th' bones;</span><br>
            But the miller served him worse than that<br>
            <span class="i1">He ground him 'twixt two stones.</span><br>
            <span class="i4">With a Ri-fol &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">9</p>

        <p>O! Barleycorn is the choicest grain<br>
            <span class="i1">That 'ere was sown on land</span><br>
            It will do more than any grain,<br>
            <span class="i1">By the turning of your hand.</span><br>
            <span class="i4">With a Ri-fol &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">10</p>

        <p>It will make a boy into a man,<br>
            <span class="i1">A man into an ass;</span><br>
            To silver it will change your gold,<br>
            <span class="i1">Your silver into brass.</span><br>
            <span class="i4">With a Ri-fol &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">11</p>

        <p>It will make the huntsman hunt the fox,<br>
            <span class="i1">That never wound a horn;</span><br>
            It will bring the tinker to the stocks<br>
            <span class="i1">That people may him scorn.</span><br>
            <span class="i4">With a Ri-fol &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">12</p>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>Aw! Come now, I'll sing you a song,<br>
            <span class="i1">'Tis a song of right merry intent,</span><br>
            Concerning a silly old man,<br>
            <span class="i1">Who went for to pay his rent,</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Singing, Too-ra-la-loo-ra-loo.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>And as this here silly old man,<br>
            <span class="i1">Was riding along the lane,</span><br>
            A Gentleman thief overtook him,<br>
            <span class="i1">Saying "Well over-taken old man."</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>"What! well over-taken, do'y say?"<br>
            <span class="i1">"Yes, well over-taken," quoth he.</span><br>
            "No, no," said the silly old man.<br>
            <span class="i1">"I don't want thy company.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>"I am only a silly old man,<br>
            <span class="i1">I farm but a parcel of ground.</span><br>
            And I am going to the landlord to pay,<br>
            <span class="i1">My rent which is just forty pound."</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>"But supposing a highway-man stopped you?<br>
            <span class="i1">For the rascals are many, men say,</span><br>
            And take all the money from off you<br>
            <span class="i1">As you ride on the king's highway?"</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>"What! supposing some fellow should stop me?<br>
            <span class="i1">Why badly the thief would be sped.</span><br>
            For the money I carry about me<br>
            <span class="i1">In the quilt o' my saddle is hid."</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>And as they were riding along,<br>
            <span class="i1">Along and along the green lane,</span><br>
            The Gentleman thief rode afore him<br>
            <span class="i1">And summoned the old man to stand.</span></p>

        <p class="center">8</p>

        <p>But the old man was crafty and cunning,<br>
            <span class="i1">As, I wot, in the world there be many,</span><br>
            Pitched his saddle clean over the hedge,<br>
            <span class="i1">Saying, "Fetch'n if thou would'st have any,"</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Singing, Too-ra-la-loo-ra-loo.</span></p>

        <p class="center">9</p>

        <p>Then the thief being thirsty for gold,<br>
            <span class="i1">And eager to get at his bags,</span><br>
            He dra'ed out his rusty old sword,<br>
            <span class="i1">And chopped up the saddle to rags.</span></p>

        <p class="center">10</p>

        <p>The old man slipped off his old mare,<br>
            <span class="i1">And mounted the thief's horse astride,</span><br>
            Clapp'd spur, and put him in a gallop,<br>
            <span class="i1">Saying "I, without teaching, can ride."</span></p>

        <p class="center">11</p>

        <p>When he to his landlord's had come,<br>
            <span class="i1">That old man was almost a-spent,</span><br>
            Says he, "Landlord, provide me a room.<br>
            <span class="i1">I be come for to pay up my rent."</span></p>

        <p class="center">12</p>

        <p>He opened the thief, his portmantle<br>
            <span class="i1">And there was a sight to behold,</span><br>
            There were five hundred pounds in silver,<br>
            <span class="i1">And five hundred pounds in gold.</span></p>

        <p class="center">13</p>

        <p>And as he was on his way home,<br>
            <span class="i1">And riding along the same lane,</span><br>
            He seed—his silly old mare,<br>
            <span class="i1">Tied up to the hedge by the mane.</span></p>

        <p class="center">14</p>

        <p>He loosed his old mare from the hedge,<br>
            <span class="i1">As she of the grass there did crib,</span><br>
            He gi'ed her a whack o' the broad o' the back,<br>
            <span class="i1">Saying "Follow me home, old Tib."</span></p>

        <p class="center">15</p>

        <p>Aw! When to his home he were come<br>
            <span class="i1">His daughter he dress'd like a duchess,</span><br>
            And his ol' woman kicked and she capered for joy,<br>
            <span class="i1">And at Christmas danced jigs on her crutches.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Singing, Too-ra-la-loo-ra-loo.</span></p>

        <p>First comes January<br>
            <span class="i1">When the sun lies very low;</span><br>
            I see in the farmer's yard<br>
            <span class="i1">The cattle feed on stro';</span><br>
            The weather being so cold<br>
            <span class="i1">While the snow lies on the ground,</span><br>
            There will be another change of moon<br>
            <span class="i1">Before the year comes round.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>Next is February,<br>
            <span class="i1">So early in the spring;</span><br>
            The Farmer ploughs the fallows<br>
            <span class="i1">The rooks their nests begin.</span><br>
            The little lambs appearing<br>
            <span class="i1">Now frisk in pretty play.</span><br>
            I think upon the increase,<br>
            <span class="i1">And thank my God, to-day.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>March it is the next month,<br>
            <span class="i1">So cold and hard and drear.</span><br>
            Prepare we now for harvest,<br>
            <span class="i1">By brewing of strong beer.</span><br>
            God grant that we who labour,<br>
            <span class="i1">May see the reaping come,</span><br>
            And drink and dance and welcome<br>
            <span class="i1">The happy Harvest Home.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>Next of Months is April,<br>
            <span class="i1">When early in the morn</span><br>
            The cheery farmer soweth<br>
            <span class="i1">To right and left the corn.</span><br>
            The gallant team come after,<br>
            <span class="i1">A-smoothing of the land.</span><br>
            May Heaven the Farmer prosper<br>
            <span class="i1">Whate'er he takes in hand.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>In May I go a walking<br>
            <span class="i1">To hear the linnets sing.</span><br>
            The blackbird and the throstle<br>
            <span class="i1">A-praising God the King.</span><br>
            It cheers the heart to hear them<br>
            <span class="i1">To see the leaves unfold,</span><br>
            The meadows scattered over<br>
            <span class="i1">With buttercups of gold.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>Full early in the morning<br>
            <span class="i1">Awakes the summer sun,</span><br>
            The month of June arriving,<br>
            <span class="i1">The cold and night are done,</span><br>
            The Cuckoo is a fine bird<br>
            <span class="i1">She whistles as she flies,</span><br>
            And as she whistles, Cuckoo,<br>
            <span class="i1">The bluer grow the skies.</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>Six months I now have named,<br>
            <span class="i1">The seventh is July.</span><br>
            Come lads and lasses gather<br>
            <span class="i1">The scented hay to dry,</span><br>
            All full of mirth and gladness<br>
            <span class="i1">To turn it in the sun,</span><br>
            And never cease till daylight sets<br>
            <span class="i1">And all the work is done.</span></p>

        <p class="center">8</p>

        <p>August brings the harvest,<br>
            <span class="i1">The reapers now advance,</span><br>
            Against their shining sickles<br>
            <span class="i1">The field stands little chance.</span><br>
            Well done! exclaims the farmer.<br>
            <span class="i1">This day is all men's friend.</span><br>
            We'll drink and feast in plenty<br>
            <span class="i1">When we the harvest end.</span></p>

        <p class="center">9</p>

        <p>By middle of September,<br>
            <span class="i1">The rake is laid aside.</span><br>
            The horses wear the breeching<br>
            <span class="i1">Rich dressing to provide,</span><br>
            All things to do in season,<br>
            <span class="i1">Me-thinks is just and right.</span><br>
            Now summer season's over<br>
            <span class="i1">The frosts begin at night.</span></p>

        <p class="center">10</p>

        <p>October leads in winter.<br>
            <span class="i1">The leaves begin to fall.</span><br>
            The trees will soon be naked<br>
            <span class="i1">No flowers left at all.</span><br>
            The frosts will bite them sharply<br>
            <span class="i1">The Elm alone is green.</span><br>
            In orchard piles of apples red<br>
            <span class="i1">For cyder press are seen.</span></p>

        <p class="center">11</p>

        <p>The eleventh month, November,<br>
            <span class="i1">The nights are cold and long,</span><br>
            By day we're felling timber,<br>
            <span class="i1">And spend the night in song.</span><br>
            In cozy chimney corner<br>
            <span class="i1">We take our toast and ale,</span><br>
            And kiss and tease the maidens,<br>
            <span class="i1">Or tell a merry tale.</span></p>

        <p class="center">12</p>

        <p>Then comes dark December,<br>
            <span class="i1">The last of months in turn.</span><br>
            With holly, box, and laurel,<br>
            <span class="i1">We house and Church adorn.</span><br>
            So now, to end my story,<br>
            <span class="i1">I wish you all good cheer.</span><br>
            A merry, happy Christmas,<br>
            <span class="i1">A prosperous New Year.</span></p>

            Again I ask'd, again I pleaded,<br>

            The boatswain did his best endeavour,<br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>I saddled my horse, and away I did ride<br>
            Till I came to an ale-house hard by the road-side,<br>
            I call'd for a pot of ale frothing and brown,<br>
            And close by the fireside I sat myself down,<br>
            <span class="i2">Singing, whack, fal-de-dee, whack, fal-de-dee!</span><br>
            <span class="i2">And I in my pocket had ONE PENNY.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>I saw there two gentlemen playing at dice,<br>
            They took me to be some nobleman nice.<br>
            With my swagger, and rapier, and countenance bold,<br>
            They thought that my pockets were well lined with gold,<br>
            <span class="i2">Singing, whack, fal-de-dee, whack, fal-de-dee!</span><br>
            <span class="i2">And I in my pocket had ONE PENNY.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>"A hearty good fellow," they said, "loveth play."<br>
            "That lies with the stakes, pretty sirs, that you lay."<br>
            Then one said "A guinea," but I said "Five Pound,"<br>
            The bet it was taken—no money laid down,<br>
            <span class="i2">Singing, whack, fal-de-dee, whack, fal-de-dee!</span><br>
            <span class="i2">And I in my pocket had ONE PENNY.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>I took up the dice, and I threw them the main,<br>
            It was my good fortune, that evening, to gain;<br>
            If they had a won, sirs, there'd been a loud curse,<br>
            When I threw in naught save a moneyless purse.<br>
            <span class="i2">Singing, whack, fal-de-dee, whack, fal-de-dee!</span><br>
            <span class="i2">And I in my pocket had ONE PENNY.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>Was ever a mortal a quarter as glad,<br>
            With the little of money at first that I had!<br>
            A hearty good fellow, as most men opine<br>
            I am; so my neighbours pray pour out the wine,<br>
            <span class="i2">Singing, whack, fal-de-dee, whack, fal-de-dee!</span><br>
            <span class="i2">And I in my pocket had FIVE POUNDS, free.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>I tarried all night, and I parted next day,<br>
            Thinks I to myself, I'll be jogging away!<br>
            I asked of the landlady what was my bill,<br>
            "O naught save a kiss of your lips, if you will."<br>
            <span class="i2">Singing, whack, fal-de-dee, whack, fal-de-dee!</span><br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>Beside the rolling ocean<br>
            <span class="i1">One morning in the month of June,</span><br>
            The feathered warbling songsters<br>
            <span class="i1">Were sweetly changing note and tune.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">I overheard a damsel fair</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Complain in words of bitter woe,</span><br>
            <span class="i3">With tear on cheek, she thus did speak,</span><br>
            <span class="i4">O for the bonny Bunch of Roses, O!</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>Then up and spake her lover<br>
            <span class="i1">And grasped the maiden by the hand,</span><br>
            Have patience, fairest, patience!<br>
            <span class="i1">A legion I will soon command.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">I'll raise ten thousand soldiers brave</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Thro' pain and peril I will go</span><br>
            <span class="i3">A branch will break, for thy sweet sake,</span><br>
            <span class="i4">A branch of the bonny Bunch of Roses, O!</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>Then sadly said his mother,<br>
            <span class="i1">As tough as truest heart of oak,</span><br>
            That stem that bears the roses,<br>
            <span class="i1">And is not easy bent or broke</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Thy father he essayed it first</span><br>
            <span class="i3">And now in France his head lies low;</span><br>
            <span class="i3">For sharpest thorn, is ever borne</span><br>
            <span class="i4">O by the bonny Bunch of Roses, O!</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>He raised a mighty army<br>
            <span class="i1">And many nobles joined his throng</span><br>
            With pipe and banner flying<br>
            <span class="i1">To pluck the rose, he march'd along:</span><br>
            <span class="i3">The stem he found was far too tough</span><br>
            <span class="i3">And piercing sharp, the thorn, I trow.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">No blossom he rent from the tree</span><br>
            <span class="i4">All of the bonny Bunch of Roses, O!</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>O mother, dearest mother!<br>
            <span class="i1">I lie upon my dying bed,</span><br>
            And like my gallant father<br>
            <span class="i1">Must hide an uncrowned, humbled head.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Let none henceforth essay to touch</span><br>
            <span class="i3">That rose so red, or full of woe,</span><br>
            <span class="i3">With bleeding hand he'll fly the Land</span><br>
            <span class="i4">The land of the bonny Bunch of Roses, O!</span></p>

        <p>I reckon the days is departed,<br>
            <span class="i1">When folks 'ud a listened to me,</span><br>
            And I feels like as one broken-hearted,<br>
            <span class="i1">A-thinking o' what used to be.</span><br>
            And I don't know as much be amended,<br>
            <span class="i1">Than was in them merry old Times,</span><br>
            When, wi' pipes and good ale, folks attended,<br>
            <span class="i1">To me and my purty old rhymes,</span><br>
            <span class="i5">CHORUS: To me and my purty old rhymes.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>'Tis true, I be cruel asthmatic<br>
            <span class="i1">I've lost every tooth i' my head;</span><br>
            And my limbs be that crim'd wi' rheumatic<br>
            <span class="i1">D'rsay I were better in bed.</span><br>
            Oh my! all the world be for reading<br>
            <span class="i1">Newspapers, and books and what not;</span><br>
            Sure—'tis only conceitedness breeding,<br>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>I reckon that wi' my brown fiddle<br>
            <span class="i1">I'd go from this cottage to that;</span><br>
            All the youngsters 'ud dance in the middle,<br>
            <span class="i1">Their pulses and feet, pit-a-pat.</span><br>
            I cu'd zing, if you'd stand me the liquor,<br>
            <span class="i1">All the night, and 'ud never give o'er</span><br>
            My voice—I don't deny it getting thicker,<br>

            <span class="i1">As sets folks about by the ear.</span><br>
            And slops makes the poorest of lushing,<br>
            <span class="i1">No zinging for me wi'out beer.</span><br>
            I reckon the days be departed<br>
            <span class="i1">For such jolly gaffers as I,</span><br>
            Folks never will be so light-hearted<br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>All you that love a bit of fun, come listen here awhile,<br>
            I'll tell you of a droll affair, will cause you all to smile.<br>
            <span class="i5">The Parson dress'd, all in his best,</span><br>
            <span class="i5">Cock'd hat and bushy wig,</span><br>
            He went into a farmer's house, to choose a sucking pig.<br>
            <span class="i5">Good morning, said the Parson; good morning, sir, to you!</span><br>
            <span class="i5">I'm come to take a sucking pig, a pig that is my due.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>Then went the farmer to the stye, amongst the piglings small,<br>
            He chose the very wee-est pig, the wee-est of them all;<br>
            <span class="i5">But when the Parson saw the choice,</span><br>
            <span class="i5">How he did stamp and roar!</span><br>
            He snorted loud, he shook his wig, he almost-cursed and swore.<br>
            <span class="i5">Good morning &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>O then out spake the Farmer, Since my offer you refuse<br>
            Pray step into the stye yourself, that you may pick and choose.<br>
            <span class="i5">So to the stye the Priest did hie,</span><br>
            <span class="i5">And there without ado,</span><br>
            The old sow ran with open mouth, and grunting at him flew.<br>
            <span class="i5">Good morning &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>She caught him by the breeches black, that loudly he did cry<br>
            O help me! help me from the sow! or surely I shall die.<br>
            <span class="i5">The little pigs his waistcoat tore,</span><br>
            <span class="i5">His stockings and his shoes,</span><br>
            The Farmer said, with bow and smile, You're welcome, sir, to choose.<br>
            <span class="i5">Good morning &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>Away the Parson scamper'd home, as fast as he could run,<br>
            His wife was standing at the door, expecting his return,<br>
            <span class="i5">But when she saw him in such plight</span><br>
            <span class="i5">She fainted clean away,</span><br>
            Alas! alas! the Parson said, I bitter rue this day.<br>
            <span class="i5">Good morning &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>Go fetch me down a suit of clothes, a sponge and soap, I pray,<br>
            And bring me, too, my greasy wig, and rub me down with hay.<br>
            <span class="i5">Another time, I won't be nice,</span><br>
            <span class="i5">When a gathering my dues;</span><br>
            Another time in sucking pigs, I will not pick and choose.<br>
            <span class="i5">Good morning, said the Parson, good morning, sirs, to you,</span><br>
            <span class="i5">I will not pick a sucking pig—I leave the choice to you.</span></p>

        <p>I went into the pantry, to see what I might see,<br>
            And there I saw three pair of boots, by one, by two, by three.<br>
            I called unto my loving wife, and "Coming Sir!" said she,<br>
            "O what do these three pair of boots without the leave of me?"<br>
            <span class="i4">"Why, old fool, blind fool! can't you very well see,</span><br>
            <span class="i4">That these are three pudding bags, my mother sent to me?"</span><br>
            "Hey boys! Well done! Pudding bags with steel spurs on,<br>
            The like," &amp;c.</p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>I went into the dairy, to see what I might see,<br>
            And there I saw three beavers, by one, by two, by three.<br>
            I call'd unto my kind wife, and "Coming Sir!" said she,<br>
            "O what do these three beavers here without the leave of me?"<br>
            <span class="i4">"Why, old fool, blind fool! can't you very well see,</span><br>
            <span class="i4">That these are three milking pails, my mother sent to me?"</span><br>
            "Hey boys! Well done! Milking pails with ribbons on,<br>
            The like," &amp;c.</p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>I went into the chamber, to see what I might see,<br>
            And there I saw three men in bed, by one, by two, by three.<br>
            I called unto my kind wife, and "Coming Sir!" said she,<br>
            "O why sleep here three gentlemen without the leave of me?"<br>
            <span class="i4">"Why old fool, blind fool! can't you very well see,</span><br>
            <span class="i4">That these are three milking maids, my mother sent to me?"</span><br>
            "Hey boys! Well done! Milking maids with beards on,<br>
            The like," &amp;c.</p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>I went about the chamber, as quick as quick might be,<br>
            I kicked the three men down the stairs, by one, by two, by three.<br>
            "Without your hats and boots be off, your horses leave and flee,<br>
            Your purses 'neath your pillows left; they too belong to me.<br>
            <span class="i4">Why old wife, blind wife! can't you very well see,</span><br>
            <span class="i4">That these are three highwaymen from justice hid by thee?"</span><br>
            "Hey boys! purses left! knaves they be, and away are flown.<br>
            The like was never known, the like was never known."<br>
            Old Wichet went a noodle out, a wise man he came home.</p>

        <p>Come hither, son Jan! since thou art a man,<br>
            <span class="i2">I'll gi'e the best counsel in life,</span><br>
            Come, sit down by me, and my story shall be,<br>
            <span class="i2">I'll tell how to get thee a wife.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Iss, I will! man, I will!</span><br>
            <span class="i5">Zure I will!</span><br>
            <span class="i3">I'll tell how to get thee a wife! Iss, I will!</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>Thy self thou must dress in thy Sunday-go-best;<br>
            <span class="i2">They'll at first turn away and be shy.</span><br>
            But boldly, kiss each purty maid that thou see'st,<br>
            <span class="i2">They'll call thee their Love, by-and-bye.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Iss, they will! man, they will!</span><br>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>So a courting Jan goes in his holiday clothes,<br>
            <span class="i2">All trim, nothing ragged and torn,</span><br>
            From his hat to his hose; with a sweet yellow rose,<br>
            <span class="i2">He looked like a gentleman born.</span><br>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>The first pretty lass that Jan did see pass,<br>
            <span class="i2">A farmer's fat daughter called Grace.</span><br>
            He'd scarce said 'How do?' and a kind word or two,<br>
            <span class="i2">Her fetched him a slap in the face.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Iss, her did! man, her did!</span><br>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>As Jan, never fearing o' nothing at all<br>
            <span class="i2">Was walking adown by the locks,</span><br>
            He kiss'd the parson's wife, which stirred up a strife<br>
            <span class="i2">And Jan was put into the stocks.</span><br>

        <p>As I was a-walking down by the sea-shore,<br>
            Where the winds whistled high, and the waters did roar,<br>
            Where the winds whistled high, and the waves raged around,<br>
            I heard a fair maid make a pitiful sound,<br>
            <span class="i4">Crying, O! my love is drowned!</span><br>
            <span class="i6">My love must I deplore!</span><br>

            <span class="i6">Shall see my love more!</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>I never a nobler, a truer did see<br>
            A lion in courage, but gentle to me,<br>
            An eye like an eagle, a heart like a dove,<br>
            And the song that he sang me was ever of love.<br>
            <span class="i4">Now I cry, O! my love is drowned!</span><br>
            <span class="i6">My love must I deplore!</span><br>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>He is sunk in the waters, there lies he asleep,<br>
            I will plunge there as well, I will kiss his cold feet,<br>
            I will kiss the white lips, once coral-like red,<br>
            And die at his side, for my true love is dead.<br>
            <span class="i4">Now I cry, O! my love is drowned.</span><br>
            <span class="i6">My love must I deplore</span><br>
            <span class="i4">And I never, O! never</span><br>

        <p>Come, listen all, both great and small<br>
            <span class="i2">To you a tale I'll tell,</span><br>
            What on this bleak and barren moor,<br>
            <span class="i2">In ancient days befell.</span><br>
            It so befell, as I've heard tell,<br>
            <span class="i2">There came the hunter Childe,</span><br>
            All day he chased on heath and waste,<br>
            <span class="i2">On Dart-a-moor so wild.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>The winds did blow, then fell the snow,<br>
            <span class="i2">He chased on Fox-tor mire;</span><br>
            He lost his way, and saw the day,<br>
            <span class="i2">And winter's sun expire.</span><br>
            Cold blew the blast, the snow fell fast,<br>
            <span class="i2">And darker grew the night;</span><br>
            He wandered high, he wandered low,<br>
            <span class="i2">And nowhere saw a light.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>In darkness blind, he could not find<br>
            <span class="i2">Where he escape might gain,</span><br>
            Long time he tried, no track espied,<br>
            <span class="i2">His labours all in vain.</span><br>
            His knife he drew, his horse he slew,<br>
            <span class="i2">As on the ground it lay;</span><br>
            He cut full deep, therein to creep,<br>
            <span class="i2">And tarry till the day.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>The winds did blow, fast fell the snow,<br>
            <span class="i2">And darker grew the night,</span><br>
            Then well he wot, he hope might not<br>
            <span class="i2">Again to see the light.</span><br>
            So with his finger dipp'd in blood,<br>
            <span class="i2">He scrabbled on the stones,—</span><br>
            "This is my will, God it fulfil,<br>
            <span class="i2">And buried be my bones.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>"Whoe'er he be that findeth me<br>
            <span class="i2">And brings me to a grave,</span><br>
            The lands that now to me belong,<br>
            <span class="i2">In Plymstock he shall have."</span><br>
            There was a cross erected then,<br>
            <span class="i2">In memory of his name;</span><br>
            And there it stands, in wild waste lands,<br>
            <span class="i2">To testify the same.</span></p>

        <p>In the days of yore, there sat at his door,<br>
            <span class="i2">An old farmer and thus sang he,</span><br>
            'With my pipe and my glass, I wish every class<br>
            <span class="i2">On the earth were as well as me!'</span><br>
            For he en-vi-ed not any man his lot,<br>
            <span class="i2">The richest, the proudest, he saw,</span><br>
            For he had home-brew'd—brown bread,<br>
            <span class="i2">And a cottage well thatch'd with straw,</span><br>
            <span class="i8">A cottage well thatch'd with straw,</span><br>
            <span class="i9">And a cottage well thatch'd with straw;</span><br>
            <span class="i8">For he had home-brew'd, brown bread,</span><br>
            <span class="i9">And a cottage well thatch'd with straw.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>'My dear old dad this snug cottage had,<br>
            <span class="i2">And he got it, I'll tell you how.</span><br>
            He won it, I wot, with the best coin got,<br>
            <span class="i2">With the sweat of an honest brow.</span><br>
            Then says my old dad, Be careful lad<br>
            <span class="i2">To keep out of the lawyer's claw.</span><br>
            So you'll have home-brew'd—brown bread,<br>
            <span class="i2">And a cottage well thatch'd with straw.</span><br>
            <span class="i8">A cottage well thatch'd with straw, &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>'The ragged, the torn, from my door I don't turn,<br>
            <span class="i2">But I give them a crust of brown;</span><br>
            And a drop of good ale, my lad, without fail,<br>
            <span class="i2">For to wash the brown crust down.</span><br>
            Tho' rich I may be, it may chance to me,<br>
            <span class="i2">That misfortune should spoil my store,</span><br>
            So—I'd lack home-brew'd—brown bread,<br>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>'Then in frost and snow to the Church I go,<br>
            <span class="i2">No matter the weather how.</span><br>
            And the service and prayer that I put up there,<br>
            <span class="i2">Is to Him who speeds the plough.</span><br>
            Sunday saints, i' feck, who cheat all the week,<br>
            <span class="i2">With a ranting and a canting jaw,</span><br>
            Not for them is my home-brew'd—brown bread,<br>
            <span class="i2">And my cottage well thatch'd with straw.</span><br>

            <span class="i8">Not for them is my home-brew'd—brown bread,</span><br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>A sweet pretty maiden sat under a tree,<br>
            She sighed and said, 'Oh! that I married might be,<br>
            <span class="i2">My daddy is so crabbed and my mammy is so cross,</span><br>
            <span class="i2">That a husband for certain could never be worse.'</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>Young Johnny he heard what the damsel did say.<br>
            He came to her side, and said smiling, 'Today<br>
            <span class="i2">I have a little cottage and I have a little horse</span><br>
            <span class="i2">I have a pleasant temper that will not grow worse.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>'If you will be mine, and to that will agree,<br>
            We'll travel together in sweet amity.<br>
            <span class="i2">There never will be wrangle, there never can be strife,</span><br>
            <span class="i2">Between a good husband and his pretty wife.'</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>The maiden replied, 'I am not very sure,<br>
            That fond matrimony my trouble will cure,<br>
            <span class="i2">From daddy and from mammy I quickly run away</span><br>
            <span class="i2">And go into service for a year and a day.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>'The ring that you hold is a link in a chain,<br>
            Will fetter my freedom, my tongue will restrain<br>
            <span class="i2">I cannot run away, and I never shall be free,</span><br>
            <span class="i2">So take your kind offer to others than me.'</span></p>

        <p>Alas! my love's enlisted,<br>
            <span class="i2">He wears a white cockade,</span><br>
            He is as gay a gallant,<br>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>"Leave off your grief and sorrow,<br>

            When I return I'll marry,<br>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>She spoke no word—her tears,<br>
            <span class="i2">They fell a salten flood;</span><br>
            And from the draggled ribbons<br>
            <span class="i2">Washed out the stains of blood.</span><br>
            "O mother I am dying!<br>

        <p>You'll not know where I am, dear girl,<br>

            My secret thoughts I will unfurl<br>

        <p>I saw a sweet maiden trip over the lea,<br>
            Her eyes were as loadstones attracting of me.<br>
            Her cheeks were the roses, that Cupid lurks in,<br>
            With a bonny blue kerchief tied under her chin.</p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>O where are you going, my fair pretty maid?<br>
            O whither so swift through the dew drops? I said,<br>
            I go to my mother, kind sir, for to spin.<br>
            O the bonny blue kerchief tied under her chin.</p>

        </p>

        <p>Why wear you that kerchief tied over your head?<br>
            'Tis the country girls' fashion, kind sir, then she said.<br>
            And the fashion young maidens will always be in<br>
            So I wear a blue kerchief tied under my chin.</p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>To kiss her sweet lips then I sought to begin,<br>
            O nay Sir! she said, 'ere a kiss you would win,<br>
            Pray show me a ring, tho' of gold the most thin.<br>
            O slyest blue kerchief tied under the chin!</p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>Why wear a <i>blue</i> kerchief, sweet maiden, I said,<br>
            Because the blue colour is one not to fade,<br>
            As a sailor's blue jacket who fights for the king,<br>
            So's my bonny blue kerchief tied under the chin.</p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>The love that I value is certain to last,<br>
            Not fading and changing, but ever set fast,<br>
            That only the colour, my love sir to win,<br>
            So goodbye from the kerchief tied under the chin.</p>

        <p>Tommy a' Lynn was a Dutchman born,<br>
            His head was bald and his chin was shorn;<br>
            He wore a cap made of rabbit's skin<br>
            With the skin side out and the wool within.<br>
            <span class="i4">All to my tooth and my link-a-lum-lee</span><br>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>Tommy a' Lynn had no boots to put on,<br>
            But two calves hides with the hair all gone.<br>
            They were split at the side and the water ran in,<br>
            I must wear wet feet, said Tommy a' Lynn.<br>

        <p>Tommy a' Lynn has a hunting gone.<br>
            A saddle of urchin's skins he put on.<br>
            The urchin's prickles were sharp as a pin,<br>
            I've got a sore seat, said Tommy a' Lynn.<br>

        <p>Tommy a' Lynn has a hunting gone.<br>

        <p>As I was a walking one morning in May,<br>
            To hear the birds whistle, see lambkins at play,<br>
            I spied a fair damsel, O sweetly sang she—<br>
            'Down by the green bushes he thinks to meet me.'</p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>'O where are you going, my sweet pretty maid?'<br>
            'My lover I'm seeking, kind sir', she said.<br>
            'Shall I be your lover, and will you agree,<br>
            To forsake the old love, and forgather with me?</p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>'I'll buy you fine beavers, a gay silken gown,<br>
            With furbelowed petticoats flounced to the ground,<br>
            If you'll leave your old love, and following me,<br>
            Forsake the green bushes, where he waits for thee?'</p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>'Quick, let us be moving, from under the trees,<br>
            Quick, let us be moving, kind sir, if you please;<br>
            For yonder my true love is coming, I see,<br>
            Down by the green bushes he thinks to meet me.'</p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>The old love arrived, the maiden was gone<br>
            He sighed very deeply, he sighed all alone,<br>
            'She is on with another, before off with me,<br>
            So, adieu ye green bushes for ever!' said he.</p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>'I'll be as a schoolboy, I'll frolic and play,<br>
            No false hearted maiden shall trouble my day,<br>
            Untroubled at night, I will slumber and snore,<br>
            So, adieu, ye green bushes! I'll fool it no more.'</p>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>One summer evening, a maiden fair<br>
            Was walking forth in the balmy air,<br>
            She met a sailor upon the way;<br>
            <span class="i4">'Maiden stay' he whispered,</span><br>
            <span class="i4">'Maiden stay' he whispered</span><br>
            <span class="i6">'O pretty maiden, stay!'</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>'Why art thou walking abroad alone?<br>
            The stars are shining, the day is done,'<br>
            O then her tears they began to flow;<br>
            <span class="i4">For a dark eyed sailor,</span><br>
            <span class="i4">For a dark eyed sailor</span><br>
            <span class="i6">Had filled her heart with woe.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>'Three years are pass'd since he left this land,<br>
            A ring of gold he took off my hand,<br>
            He broke the token, a half to keep,<br>
            <span class="i4">Half he bade me treasure,</span><br>
            <span class="i4">Half he bade me treasure,</span><br>
            <span class="i6">Then crossed the briny deep.'</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>'O drive him damsel from out your mind,<br>
            For men are changeful as is the wind,<br>
            And love, inconstant will quickly grow<br>
            <span class="i4">Cold as winter morning</span><br>
            <span class="i4">Cold as winter morning</span><br>
            <span class="i6">When lands are white with snow.'</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>'Above the snow is the holly seen,<br>
            In bitter blast it abideth green,<br>
            And blood-red drops it as berries bears<br>
            <span class="i4">So my aching bosom,</span><br>
            <span class="i4">So my aching bosom,</span><br>
            <span class="i6">Its truth and sorrow wears.'</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>Then half the ring did the sailor show,<br>
            Away with weeping and sorrow now!<br>
            'In bands of marriage united we<br>
            <span class="i4">Like the broken Token</span><br>

        <p>Old Uncle Pengerric a Captain was,<br>

            Who feathered his nest from the keenly lode<br>
            <span class="i1">That ruined you and me.</span><br>
            The Captain was traversing Brandy Moor,<br>
            <span class="i1">With hazel twig in hand,</span><br>
            The hazel twisted and turned about<br>
            <span class="i1">And brought him to a stand.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">CHORUS. Oh! the keenly lode, the keenly lode</span><br>

        <p>Old Uncle Pengerric so big did brag<br>
            <span class="i1">Of ore in Brandy Bâll,</span><br>
            "Come fork out your money my Christian friends,<br>
            <span class="i1">Your fortunes treble all."</span><br>
            Now Uncle was reckoned a preacher stout,<br>
            <span class="i1">A burning and shining light.</span><br>
            The people all said, "What he has in head<br>
            <span class="i1">Will surely turn out right."</span><br>
            <span class="i3">CHORUS. Oh! the keenly lode, &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>The Company floated, the Shares up paid,<br>
            <span class="i1">The gold came flowing in.</span><br>
            He set up a whim, and began to sink<br>
            <span class="i1">For the keenly lode of tin.</span><br>
            He had not burrowed but five foot six<br>
            <span class="i1">'Ere he came to a buried hoss.</span><br>
            Said Uncle Pengerric, "No fault of mine,<br>

        <p>The shaft descended, but ne'er a grain<br>
            <span class="i1">Of ore was brought to ground.</span><br>
            And presently Uncle Pengerric too,<br>
            <span class="i1">Was not in Cornwall found.</span><br>
            But wherever he goes, and whenever he talks,<br>
            <span class="i1">He says:—"The rod told true,</span><br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>Awake, ye pretty maids, awake,<br>
            <span class="i1">Refreshed from drowsy dream,</span><br>
            And haste to dairy house, and take<br>
            <span class="i1">For us a dish of cream.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>If not a dish of yellow cream,<br>
            <span class="i1">Then give us kisses three;</span><br>
            The woodland bower is white with flower,<br>
            <span class="i1">And green is every tree.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>A branch of May we bear about<br>
            <span class="i1">Before the door it stands;</span><br>
            There's not a sprout unbudded out,<br>
            <span class="i1">The work of God's own hands.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>Awake, awake ye pretty maids,<br>
            <span class="i1">And take the May-bush in,</span><br>
            Or 'twill be gone ere tomorrow morn,<br>
            <span class="i1">And you'll have none within.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>Throughout the night, before the light,<br>
            <span class="i1">There fell the dew or rain,</span><br>
            It twinkles bright on May bush white,<br>
            <span class="i1">It sparkles on the plain.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>The heavenly gates are open wide<br>
            <span class="i1">To let escape the dew,</span><br>
            And heavenly grace falls on each place<br>
            <span class="i1">It drops on us and you.</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>The life of man is but a span,<br>
            <span class="i1">He blossoms as a flower,</span><br>
            He makes no stay, is here to-day,<br>
            <span class="i1">And vanish'd in an hour.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a

        </p>

        <p class="center">8</p>

        <p>My song is done, I must be gone,<br>
            <span class="i1">Nor make a longer stay.</span><br>
            God bless you all, both great and small,<br>
            <span class="i1">And send you gladsome May.</span></p>

        <p>There came an Earl a riding by,<br>
            <span class="i1">A gipsy maid espyed he;</span><br>
            "O nut-brown maid, from green-wood glade,<br>
            <span class="i1">O prithee come along with me."</span><br>
            "In green-wood glade, fair Sir!" she said,<br>
            <span class="i1">"I am so blythe, as bird so gay.</span><br>
            In thy castle tall, in bower and hall,<br>
            <span class="i1">I fear for grief I'd pine away."</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>"Thou shalt no more be set in stocks,<br>
            <span class="i1">And tramp about from town to town,</span><br>
            But thou shalt ride in pomp and pride<br>
            <span class="i1">In velvet red and broidered gown."</span><br>
            "My brothers three no more I'd see,<br>
            <span class="i1">If that I went with thee, I trow.</span><br>
            They sing me to sleep, with songs so sweet,<br>

        <p>"Thou shalt not be torn by thistle and thorn,<br>
            <span class="i1">With thy bare feet all in the dew.</span><br>
            But shoes shall wear of Spanish leather<br>
            <span class="i1">And silken stockings all of blue."</span><br>
            "I will not go to thy castle high,<br>
            <span class="i1">For thou wilt weary soon, I know,</span><br>
            Of the gipsy maid, from green-wood glade,<br>
            <span class="i1">And drive her forth in rain and snow."</span></p>

        <p>"All night you lie neath the starry sky<br>
            <span class="i1">In rain and snow you trudge all day,</span><br>
            But thy brown head, in a feather bed,<br>
            <span class="i1">When left the gipsies, thou shalt lay."</span><br>
            "I love to lie 'neath the starry sky,<br>
            <span class="i1">I do not heed the snow and rain,</span><br>
            But fickle as wind, I fear to find<br>

        <p>"I will thee wed, sweet maid," he said,<br>

            Thy days shall be spent in merriment;<br>
            <span class="i1">For us the marriage bells shall swing."</span><br>
            The dog did howl, and screech'd the owl,<br>
            <span class="i1">The raven croaked, the night-wind sighed;</span><br>

        <p>'Nay, thou shalt not!' then he drew, I wot,<br>
            <span class="i1">The sword that hung at his saddle bow,</span><br>
            And once he smote on her lily-white throat,<br>

            <span class="i8">Down did flow, &amp;c.</span></p>

            She sank on her side, and so she died,<br>

    <div class="poem">

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>Young Roger, the Miller, went courting of late<br>
            A farmer's sweet daughter called Beautiful Kate;<br>
            Now Kitty was buxom, and bonny and fair,<br>
            Had plenty of humour, of frolic a share,<br>
            And her father possessed an uncommon grey mare,<br>
            <span class="i10">A grey mare, a grey mare,</span><br>
            <span class="i10">An uncommon grey mare.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>So Roger he dressed himself up as a beau,<br>
            He comb'd down his locks, and in collars of snow,<br>
            He went to the farmer, and said, "How d'y do?<br>
            I love pretty Kitty, to her I'll prove true;<br>
            Will you give me the grey mare and Katherine too,<br>
            <span class="i10">The grey mare, the grey mare &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>"She's a very nice maiden, a-courting I'm come.<br>
            Lawks! how I would like the grey mare to ride home!<br>
            I love your sweet daughter so much I declare,<br>
            I'm ready my mill—and my stable—to share,<br>
            With Kitty the charming, and with the grey mare,<br>
            <span class="i10">The grey mare, the grey mare &amp;c."</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>"You're welcome to her, to her hand and her heart,<br>
            But from the grey mare, man, I never will part."<br>
            So said the old farmer,—then Roger, "I swear,<br>
            It is up with my courting, for Kate I don't care,<br>
            Unless I be given as well the grey mare.<br>
            <span class="i10">The grey mare, the grey mare &amp;c."</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>The years had pass'd swiftly, when withered and grey,<br>
            Old Roger, the Miller, met Katherine one day,<br>
            Said he, "I remember you, buxom and fair,<br>
            As roses your cheeks and as broom was your hair<br>
            And I came a courting!—Ah, Kate! the grey mare,<br>
            <span class="i10">The grey mare, the grey mare &amp;c."</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>"I remember your coming to court the grey mare<br>
            Very well, M<span class="super">r.</span> Roger, when golden my hair,<br>
            And cheeks were as roses that bloom on the wall.<br>
            But, lawks! M<span class="super">r.</span> Roger,—I can not recall<br>
            That e'er you came sweet-hearting <i>me</i>, man, at all,<br>
            <span class="i10">But the mare, the grey mare</span><br>
            <span class="i10">That uncommon grey mare."</span></p>

        <p>Come all you brisk young sailors bold<br>
            <span class="i1">That plough the raging main,</span><br>
            A tragedy I will unfold<br>
            <span class="i1">In story sad and plain.</span><br>
            From my true love 'twas pressed was I<br>
            <span class="i1">The gallant ship to steer</span><br>
            To Indies west,—each heart beat high<br>
            <span class="i1">With confidence and cheer.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>A year was gone, and home at last,<br>
            <span class="i1">We turn'd with swelling sail,</span><br>
            When—'ere the Scilly over-passed<br>
            <span class="i1">There broke on us a gale.</span><br>
            The boatswain up aloft did go.<br>
            <span class="i1">He went aloft so high.</span><br>
            More angry did the ocean grow,<br>
            <span class="i1">More menacing the sky.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>To make the stripe in vain we tried<br>
            <span class="i1">The Scilly rocks to clear,</span><br>
            The thunder of the furious tide<br>
            <span class="i1">Was filling every ear.</span><br>
            There came a sharp and sudden shock,—<br>
            <span class="i1">Each thought of wife and home!</span><br>
            The gallant ship was on a rock,<br>
            <span class="i1">And swept with wave and foam.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>Of eighty seamen 'prised the crew,<br>
            <span class="i1">But one did reach the shore,</span><br>
            The gallant vessel, good and true,<br>
            <span class="i1">Was shattered aft and fore.</span><br>
            The news to Plymouth swift did fly,<br>
            <span class="i1">That our good ship was gone;</span><br>
            And wet with tears was many an eye,<br>
            <span class="i1">And many a widow lone.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>And when I came to Plymouth sound<br>
            <span class="i1">Alive, of eighty dead,</span><br>
            My pretty love, then false I found<br>
            <span class="i1">And to a landsman wed.</span><br>
            O gentles all that live on land<br>
            <span class="i1">Be-think the boys at sea,</span><br>
            Lo! here I stand with cap in hand,<br>
            <span class="i1">And crave your charity.</span></p>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>In merry Scotland, in merry Scotland,<br>
            <span class="i1">There lived brothers three,</span><br>
            They all did cast lots which of them should go,<br>
            <span class="i1">A robbing upon the salt sea.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>The lot it fell upon Henry Martyn,<br>
            <span class="i1">The youngest of the three,</span><br>
            That he should go rob on the salt, salt sea,<br>
            <span class="i1">To maintain his brothers and he.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>He had not a sailed a long winter's night,<br>
            <span class="i1">Nor yet a short winter's day,</span><br>
            Before he espied the King's gallant ship,<br>
            <span class="i1">Come sailing along that way.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>How far, how far, cried Henry Martyn,<br>
            <span class="i1">How far are you going? said he</span><br>
            For I am a robber upon the salt seas,<br>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>Stand off, stand off! the Captain he cried,<br>
            <span class="i1">The lifeguards they are aboard.</span><br>
            My cannons are loaden with powder and shot;<br>
            <span class="i1">And every man hath a sword.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>For three long hours they merrily fought,<br>
            <span class="i1">For hours they fought full three.</span><br>
            And many a blow it dealt many a wound,<br>
            <span class="i1">As they fought on the salt, salt sea.</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>Twas broadside against a broadside then,<br>
            <span class="i1">And at it, the which should win,</span><br>
            A shot in the gallant ship bored a hole,<br>
            <span class="i1">And then did the water rush in.</span></p>

        <p class="center">8</p>

        <p>Bad news! bad news, for old England<br>
            <span class="i1">Bad news has come to the town,</span><br>

        <p>O the fair town of Plymouth is by the sea-side,<br>
            The Sound is so blue, and so still and so wide,<br>
            Encircled with hills and with forests all green,<br>

        <p>O the maidens of Plymouth are comely and sweet,<br>

        <p>O the bells of old Plymouth float over the bay,<br>
            My heart it does melt, as I'm sailing away.<br>

        <p>For the maidens of Plymouth my love is so hot,<br>

        <p>The fox went out one winter night,<br>

            For he'd many a mile to go that night,<br>

            For he'd many a mile to go that night,<br>
            <span class="i2">Before he reached his den, O!</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>At last he came to a farmer's yard,<br>
            Where ducks and geese were all afear'd,<br>
            "The best of you all shall grease my beard,<br>
            <span class="i2">Before I leave the Town O!</span><br>

            The best of you all &amp;c."</p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>He took the grey goose by the neck,<br>
            He laid a duck across his back,<br>
            And heeded not their quack! quack! quack!<br>

            And heeded not &amp;c.</p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>Then old mother Slipper Slopper jump'd out of bed<br>
            And out of the window she pop't her head,<br>
            Crying "Oh! John, John! the grey goose is dead,<br>
            <span class="i2">And the fox is over the down, O!"</span><br>

        <p>Then John got up to the top o' the hill,<br>
            And blew his horn both loud and shrill,<br>
            "Blow on" said Reynard, "your music still,<br>
            <span class="i2">Whilst I trot home to my den, O!"</span><br>
            <span class="i4">Den, O! Den, O!</span><br>
            "Blow on" said Reynard &amp;c.</p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>At last he came to his cosy den,<br>
            Where sat his young ones, nine or ten.<br>
            Quoth they, "Daddy, you must go there again,<br>
            <span class="i2">For sure, 'tis a lucky town, O!"</span><br>
            <span class="i4">Town, O! Town, O!</span><br>
            Quoth they, "Daddy, &amp;c."</p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>The fox and wife without any strife,<br>
            They cut up the goose without fork or knife,<br>
            And said 'twas the best they had eat in their life,<br>
            <span class="i2">And the young ones pick'd the bones, O!</span><br>
            <span class="i4">Bones, O! Bones, O!</span><br>
            And said 'twas the best, &amp;c.</p>

        <p>There's not a cloud a sailing by,<br>
            <span class="i1">That does not hold a shower;</span><br>
            There's not a furze-bush on the moor,<br>

            About the roots we need not delve,<br>
            <span class="i1">The branches need not prune,</span><br>
            The yellow furze will ever flower,<br>

            It blossoms in the falling snow,<br>
            <span class="i1">It blazes bright in June,</span><br>
            And love, like it, is always here,<br>

            And the oxen home returning<br>

        <p>O the Ploughboy was a ploughing<br>
            With his horses on the plain,<br>
            <span class="i3">And was singing of a song as on went he.</span><br>
            "Since that I have fall'n in love,<br>
            If the parents disapprove,<br>
            <span class="i3">'Tis the first thing that will send me to the sea."</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>When the parents came to know<br>
            That their daughter loved him so,<br>
            <span class="i3">Then they sent a gang, and pressed him for the sea.</span><br>
            And they made of him a tar,<br>
            To be slain in cruel war;<br>
            <span class="i3">Of the simple Ploughboy singing on the lea.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>The maiden sore did grieve,<br>
            And without a word of leave,<br>
            <span class="i3">From her father's house she fled secretlie,</span><br>
            In male attire dress'd,<br>
            With a star upon her breast,<br>
            <span class="i3">All to seek her simple Ploughboy on the sea.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>Then she went o'er hill and plain,<br>
            And she walked in wind and rain,<br>
            <span class="i3">Till she came to the brink of the blue sea.</span><br>
            Saying, "I am forced to rove,<br>
            For the loss of my true love,<br>
            <span class="i3">Who is but a simple Ploughboy from the lea."</span></p>

        <p class="center">5<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a

                class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

        <p>Now the first she did behold,<br>
            O it was a sailor bold,<br>
            <span class="i3">"Have you seen my simple ploughboy?" then said she.</span><br>
            "They have press'd him to the fleet,<br>
            Sent him tossing on the deep,<br>
            <span class="i3">Who is but a simple Ploughboy from the lea."</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>Then she went to the Captain,<br>
            And to him she made complain,<br>
            <span class="i3">"O a silly Ploughboy's run away from me!"</span><br>
            Then the Captain smiled and said,<br>
            "Why Sir! surely you're a maid!<br>
            <span class="i3">So the Ploughboy I will render up to thee."</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>Then she pullèd out a store,<br>
            Of five hundred crowns and more,<br>
            <span class="i3">And she strewed them on the deck, did she,</span><br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>O Adam was a ploughboy, when ploughing first begun,<br>
            The next that did succeed him was Cain, his eldest son;<br>
            Some of the generation the calling still pursue,<br>
            That bread may not be wanting, they labour at the plough.</p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>Samson was the strongest man, and Solomon was wise,<br>
            And Alexander conquering, he made the world his prize,<br>
            King David was a valiant man, and many thousands slew,<br>
            Yet none of all these heroes bold could live without the plough.</p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>Behold the wealthy merchant, that trades on foreign seas,<br>
            And brings home gold and treasure, for such as live at ease,<br>
            With spices and with cinnamon, and oranges also,<br>
            They're brought us from the Indies, by virtue of the plough.</p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>I hope there's none offended at me for singing this,<br>
            For never I intended to sing you ought amiss.<br>
            And if you well consider, you'll find the saying true,<br>
            That all mankind dependeth upon the painful plough.</p>

        <p>Come all you young fellows that carry a gun,<br>
            Beware of late shooting when daylight is done;<br>
            For 'tis little you reckon what hazards you run,<br>
            I shot my true love at the setting of the sun<br>

        <p>I'll fly from my country, I nowhere find rest<br>

            I wait and expect till life's little span done<br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>'Twas early one morning at breaking of day,<br>
            The cocks were a crowing, the farmer did say,<br>
            Come, arise, my good fellows, arise with good will,<br>
            For your horses want something their bellies to fill.<br>
            <span class="i3">With rubbing and scrubbing, I swear and I vow,</span><br>
            <span class="i3">That we're all jolly fellows that follow the plough.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>We jump'd out of bed and slipp'd into our clothes,<br>
            Away to the stable each merrily goes.<br>
            When six o'clock cometh, to breakfast we go,<br>
            To good bread and cheese and the best of stingo.<br>
            <span class="i3">With rubbing and scrubbing, I swear and I vow,</span><br>
            <span class="i3">That we're all jolly fellows that follow the plough.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>When seven o'clock soundeth to work we do go,<br>
            We hitch up our horses and halloo Wee Woo!<br>
            At eight o' clock, lads, we are merry and bold,<br>
            To see of us which the best furrow can hold.<br>
            <span class="i3">With rubbing and scrubbing, I swear and I vow,</span><br>
            <span class="i3">That we're all jolly fellows that follow the plough.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>The farmer came to us, and thus did he say,<br>
            "What have you been doing lads, all the long day?<br>
            You've not ploughed your acre, I swear and I vow,<br>
            You are all lazy fellows that follow the plough."<br>
            <span class="i3">With rubbing and scrubbing, I swear and I vow,</span><br>
            <span class="i3">That we're all jolly fellows that follow the plough.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>The carter turns round with a twinkling eye,<br>
            "We have all ploughed our acre, I tell you no lie,<br>
            We have all ploughed our acre, I swear and I vow,<br>
            So we're the right fellows that follow the plough."<br>
            <span class="i3">With rubbing and scrubbing, I swear and I vow,</span><br>
            <span class="i3">That we're all jolly fellows that follow the plough.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>The farmer he laughed for he lovèd a joke<br>
            "It is past two o'clock, boys, 'tis time to unyoke.<br>
            Unharness your horses and rub them down well,<br>
            And so I will give you a jug of brown ale."<br>
            <span class="i3">With rubbing and scrubbing, I swear and I vow,</span><br>
            <span class="i3">That we're all jolly fellows that follow the plough.</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>So, all my fine fellows, wherever you be,<br>
            Come take my advice and be rulèd by me.<br>
            Draw your furrows aright; plough your acre and know<br>
            That such are the fellows to follow the plough.<br>
            <span style="margin-left: 3em;">With rubbing and scrubbing, I swear and I vow,</span><br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>A ship I have got in the North Country<br>
            And she goes by the name of the Golden Vanity,<br>
            O I fear she'll be taken by a Spanish Ga-la-lie,<br>
            <span class="i3">As she sails by the Low-lands low.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>To the Captain then upspake the little Cabin-boy,<br>
            He said, What is my fee, if the galley I destroy?<br>
            The Spanish Ga-la-lie, if no more it shall annoy,<br>
            <span class="i3">As you sail by the Low-lands low.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>Of silver and gold I will give to you a store;<br>
            And my pretty little daughter that dwelleth on the shore,<br>
            Of treasure and of fee as well, I'll give to thee galore,<br>
            <span class="i3">As we sail by the Low-lands low.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>Then the boy bared his breast, and straightway leaped in,<br>
            And he held all in his hand, an augur sharp and thin,<br>
            And he swam until he came to the Spanish galleon,<br>
            <span class="i3">As she lay by the Low-lands low.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>He bored with the augur, he bored once and twice,<br>
            And some were playing cards, and some were playing dice,<br>
            When the water flowed in it dazzled their eyes,<br>
            <span class="i3">And she sank by the Low-lands low.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a
                href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#Footnote_20_20"
                class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

        <p>So the Cabin-boy did swim all to the larboard side,<br>
            Saying Captain! take me in, I am drifting with the tide!<br>
            I will shoot you! I will kill you! the cruel Captain cried,<br>
            <span class="i3">You may sink by the Low-lands low.</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>Then the Cabin-boy did swim all to the starboard side<br>
            Saying, Messmates take me in, I am drifting with the tide!<br>
            Then they laid him on the deck, and he closed his eyes and died,<br>
            <span class="i3">As they sailed by the Low-lands low.</span></p>

        <p class="center">8<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a

                class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

        <p>They sewed his body up, all in an old cow's hide,<br>
            And they cast the gallant cabin-boy, over the ship's side,<br>
            And left him without more ado adrifting with the tide,<br>
            <span class="i3">And to sink by the Low-lands low.</span></p>

        <p>As I walked out one May morning,<br>

        <p>Stay, fair one, stay! Thus did I say,<br>

            My tale of love, your heart will move,<br>

        <p>One morning so gay, in the glad month of May,<br>
            <span class="i1">When I from my cottage strayed;</span><br>
            As broke the ray of awakening day,<br>
            <span class="i1">I met a pretty maid.</span><br>
            A neat little lass on the twinkling grass,<br>
            <span class="i1">To see, my foot I stayed.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>"My fair pretty maid, why wander?" I said,<br>
            <span class="i1">"So early, tell me now?"</span><br>
            The maid replied, "Pretty Sir!" and sighed,<br>
            <span class="i1">"I've lost my Spotted Cow.</span><br>
            She's stolen," she said, many tears she shed,<br>
            <span class="i1">"Or lost, I can't tell how."</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>"No further complain in dolorous strain,<br>
            <span class="i1">I've tidings will you cheer.</span><br>
            I know she's strayed, in yonder green glade,<br>
            <span class="i1">Come, love! I'll shew you where.</span><br>
            So dry up your tears and banish fears,<br>
            <span class="i1">And bid begone despair."</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>"I truly confess in my bitter distress,<br>
            <span class="i1">You are most good," said she.</span><br>
            "With help so kind, I am certain to find<br>
            <span class="i1">My cow, so I'll with thee.</span><br>
            Four eyes, it is true, are better than two,<br>
            <span class="i1">And friend, four eyes have we."</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>Through meadow and grove, we together did rove,<br>
            <span class="i1">We crossed the flow'ry dale,</span><br>
            Both morn and noon, we strayed till the moon<br>
            <span class="i1">Above our heads did sail.</span><br>
            The old Spotted Cow, clean forgotten was now,<br>
            <span class="i1">For love was all our tale.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>Now never a day, do I go my way,<br>
            <span class="i1">To handle flail or plough.</span><br>
            She comes again, and whispers, "Sweet swain,<br>
            <span class="i1">I've lost my Spotted Cow."</span><br>
            I pretend not to hear, she shouts, "My dear,<br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>O once I lay in stable, a hunter, well and warm,<br>
            I had the best of shelter, from cold and rain and harm;<br>
            But now in open meadow, a hedge I'm glad to find,<br>
            To shield my sides from tempest, from driving sleet and wind.<br>
            <span class="i4">Poor old horse, let him die!</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>My shoulders once were sturdy, were glossy, smooth and round,<br>
            But now, alas! they're rotten, I'm not accounted sound.<br>
            As I have grown so aged, my teeth gone to decay,<br>
            My master frowns upon me; I often hear him say,<br>
            <span class="i4">Poor old horse, let him die!</span></p>

        <p class="center">3<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a
                href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#Footnote_23_23"
                class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

        <p>A groom upon me waited, on straw I snugly lay,<br>
            When fields were full of flowers, the air was sweet with hay;<br>
            But now there's no good feeding prepared for me at all,<br>
            I'm forced to munch the nettles upon the kennel wall.<br>
            <span class="i4">Poor old horse, let him die!</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>My shoes and skin, the huntsman, that covets them shall have,<br>
            My flesh and bones the hounds, Sir! I very freely give,<br>
            I've followed them full often, aye! many a score of miles,<br>
            O'er hedges, walls and ditches, nor blinked at gates and stiles.<br>
            <span class="i4">Poor old horse, let him die!</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>Ye gentlemen of England, ye sportsmen good and bold,<br>
            All you that love a hunter, remember him when old,<br>
            O put him in your stable, and make the old boy warm,<br>
            And visit him and pat him, and keep him out of harm,<br>
            <span class="i4">Poor old horse, till he die!</span></p>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>'Tis of a jolly ploughing-man,<br>
            <span class="i1">Was ploughing of his land,</span><br>
            He called, Ho! he called, Wo!<br>
            <span class="i1">And bade his horses stand.</span><br>
            Upon his plough he sat, I trow,<br>
            <span class="i1">And loud began to sing,</span><br>
            His voice rang out, so clear and stout,<br>
            <span class="i1">It made the horse bells ring.</span><br>
            <span class="i2">For a nutting we will go, my boys,</span><br>
            <span class="i3">A nutting we will go,</span><br>
            <span class="i2">From hazel bush, loud sings the thrush,</span><br>
            <span class="i3">A nutting we will go!</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>A maiden sly was passing by<br>
            <span class="i1">With basket on her arm,</span><br>
            She stood to hear his singing clear,<br>
            <span class="i1">To listen was no harm.</span><br>
            The ploughboy stayed that pretty maid,<br>
            <span class="i1">And clasped her middle small,</span><br>
            He kissed her twice, he kissed her thrice<br>
            <span class="i1">Ere she could cry or call.</span><br>
            <span class="i2">For a nutting &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>Now all you pretty maidens that<br>
            <span class="i1">Go nutting o'er the grass</span><br>
            Attend my rede, and give good heed,<br>
            <span class="i1">Of ploughboys that you pass.</span><br>
            When lions roar, on Afric's shore,<br>
            <span class="i1">No mortal ventures near,</span><br>
            When hoots the owl, and bears do growl,<br>
            <span class="i1">The heart is full of fear.</span><br>
            <span class="i2">For a nutting &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>And yet, 'tis said, to pretty maid,<br>
            <span class="i1">There is a graver thing,</span><br>
            In any clime, at any time,—<br>
            <span class="i1">A ploughboy that doth sing.</span><br>
            So all you maidens, young and fair<br>
            <span class="i1">Take lesson from my lay,</span><br>
            When you do hear a ploughman sing,<br>
            <span class="i1">Then lightly run away.</span><br>
            <span class="i2">For a nutting &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p>'Twas in the prime of summer time,<br>
            <span class="i1">When hay it was a making;</span><br>
            And harvest tide was coming on,<br>
            <span class="i1">And barley wanted raking;</span><br>
            Two woeful lovers met one day,<br>
            With sighs their sad farewell to say,<br>
            For John to place must go away,<br>
            <span class="i1">And Betty's heart was breaking.</span><br>
            <span class="i2">Lovers oft have proved untrue;</span><br>
            <span class="i2">'las! what can poor maidens do?</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>But hardly was her sweet-heart gone,<br>
            <span class="i1">With vows of ne'er forsaking;</span><br>
            The foolish wench did so take on,<br>
            <span class="i1">To ease her bosom's aching—</span><br>
            She sent a letter to her love,<br>
            Invoking all the powers above,<br>
            If he should e'er inconstant prove,<br>
            <span class="i1">To her and the Barley raking.</span><br>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>Now when this letter reached the youth,<br>
            <span class="i1">It put him in a taking;</span><br>
            Sure of each other's love and truth,<br>
            <span class="i1">Why such a fuss be making?</span><br>
            But being a tender hearted swain,<br>
            From hasty words he did refrain,<br>
            And wrote to her in gentle strain,<br>
            <span class="i1">To bid her cease from quaking.</span><br>
            <span class="i2">Lovers oft have proved untrue;</span><br>

            <span class="i1">And face all wind and weather;</span><br>
            And when the year has run its race,<br>
            I'll seek a new and nearer place;<br>

        <p>A ship came sailing over the sea<br>

        <p>Ten thousand ladies in the room,<br>

            I said I would have her or none.</p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>I leaned my back against an oak,<br>
            But first it bent and then it broke,<br>
            Untrusty as I found that tree,<br>
            So did my love prove false to me.</p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>Down in a mead the other day,<br>
            As carelessly I went my way,<br>
            And plucked flowers red and blue,<br>
            I little thought what love could do.</p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>I saw a Rose with ruddy blush,<br>
            And thrust my hand into the bush,<br>
            I pricked my fingers to the bone,<br>
            I would I'd left that rose alone!</p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>I wish! I wish! but 'tis in vain,<br>
            I wish I had my heart again!<br>
            With silver chain and diamond locks,<br>
            I'd fasten it in a golden box.</p>

        <p>'Twas in the month of May, when flowers spring,<br>
            When pretty lambkins play, and thrushes sing.<br>
            When young men do resort<br>

        <p>Crantock and Newlyn men, all in one room,<br>

            My name is Willy Coombe,<br>

        <p>'Twas by a musket ball so swift did fly<br>
            Which pierced my body through, so I must die.<br>
            My brother swift did ride;<br>
            To Truro Town he hied.<br>
            <span class="i2">Alas! alack-a-day, my cruel lot!</span></p>

        <p>'Twas early I walked on a midsummer morning,<br>
            <span class="i1">The fields and the meadows were deckèd and gay,</span><br>
            The small birds were singing, the woodlands a-ringing,<br>
            <span class="i1">'Twas early in the morning, at breaking of day,</span><br>
            I will play on my pipes, I will sing thee my lay!<br>
            It is early in the morning, at breaking of day.</p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>O hark! and O hark! to the nightingales wooing,<br>
            <span class="i1">The lark is aloft piping shrill in the air.</span><br>
            In every green bower the turtle-doves cooing,<br>
            <span class="i1">The sun is just gleaming, arise up my fair!</span><br>
            Arise, love, arise! none fairer I spie!<br>
            Arise, love, arise! O why should I die?</p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>Arise, love, arise! go and get your love posies,<br>
            <span class="i1">The fairest of flowers in garden that grows,</span><br>
            Go gather me lilies, carnations and roses,<br>
            <span class="i1">I'll wear them with thoughts of the maiden I chose.</span><br>
            I stand at thy door, pretty love, full of care,<br>

        <p>O why love, O why, should I banished be from thee?<br>
            <span class="i1">O why should I see my own chosen no more?</span><br>
            O why look your parents so slightingly on me?<br>
            <span class="i1">It is all for the rough ragged garments I wore,</span><br>
            But dress me with flowers, I'm gay as a king,<br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>There were three drunken maidens,<br>
            <span class="i1">Came from the Isle of Wight.</span><br>
            They drank from Monday morning,<br>
            <span class="i1">Nor stayed till Saturday night.</span><br>
            When Saturday night did come, Sirs!<br>
            <span class="i1">They would not then go out;</span><br>
            Not the three drunken maidens,<br>
            <span class="i1">As they pushed the jug about.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>Then came in Bouncing Sally,<br>
            <span class="i1">With cheeks as red as bloom.</span><br>
            "Make space, my jolly sisters,<br>
            <span class="i1">Now make for Sally room.</span><br>
            For that I will be your equal,<br>
            <span class="i1">Before that I go out."</span><br>
            So now four drunken maidens,<br>
            <span class="i1">They pushed the jug about.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>It was woodcock and pheasant,<br>
            <span class="i1">And partridges and hare,</span><br>
            It was all kinds of dainties,<br>
            <span class="i1">No scarcity was there.</span><br>
            It was four quarts of Malaga,<br>
            <span class="i1">Each fairly did drink out,</span><br>
            So the four drunken maidens,<br>
            <span class="i1">They pushed the jug about.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>Then down came the landlord,<br>
            <span class="i1">And asked for his pay.</span><br>
            O! a forty-pound bill, Sirs!<br>
            <span class="i1">The damsels drew that day.</span><br>
            It was ten pounds apiece, Sirs!<br>
            <span class="i1">But yet, they would not out.</span><br>
            So the four drunken maidens,<br>
            <span class="i1">They pushed the jug about.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>"O where be your spencers?<br>
            <span class="i1">Your mantles rich and fine?"</span><br>
            "They all be a swallowed<br>
            <span class="i1">In tankards of good wine."</span><br>
            "O where be your characters<br>
            <span class="i1">Ye maidens brisk and gay?"</span><br>
            "O they be a swallowed!<br>
            <span class="i1">We've drunk them clean away."</span></p>

            <span class="i2">It shows our decay;</span><br>

            <span class="i2">Gone with a touch;</span><br>

        <p>The pipe that is so foul within,<br>

        <p>I courted a maiden both buxom and gay,<br>
            Unheeding what people against her did say,<br>
            I thought her as constant and true as the day.<br>
            <span class="i2">But now she is going to be married.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>O when to the church I my fair love saw go,<br>
            I followed her up with a heart full of woe,<br>
            And eyes that with tears of grief did o'erflow,<br>
            <span class="i2">To see how my suit had miscarried.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>O when in the chancel I saw my love stan',<br>
            With ring on her finger, and true love in han',<br>
            I thought that for certain 'twas not the right man,<br>
            <span class="i2">Although 'twas the man she was taking.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>O when I my fair love saw sit in her seat<br>
            I sat myself by her, but nothing could eat;<br>
            Her company, thought I, was better than meat,<br>
            <span class="i2">Although my heart sorely was aching.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>O woe be the day that I courted the maid,<br>
            That ever I trusted a word that she said,<br>
            That with her I wander'd along the green glade,<br>
            <span class="i2">Accurs'd be the day that I met her.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>O make me a grave that is long, wide and deep,<br>
            And cover me over with flowers so sweet,<br>
            That there I may lie, and may take my last sleep;<br>
            <span class="i2">For that is the way to forget her.</span></p>

        <p>As Jan was hurrying down the glade,<br>
            <span class="i1">He met his sweetheart Kit;</span><br>
            "O whither so fast?" the maiden ask'd,<br>
            <span class="i1">"Let's bide and talk a bit."</span><br>
            "I'm going to the barn, and if you'll come,<br>
            <span class="i1">And help me thresh the stro',</span><br>
            That task complete, why then my sweet,<br>
            <span class="i1">A ramble we will go."</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>She gave consent, to work they went,<br>
            <span class="i1">As if 'twere only play;</span><br>
            The flail he plied, whilst Kit untied,<br>
            <span class="i1">The sheaves, and cleared away.</span><br>
            O willing hands made labour light,<br>
            <span class="i1">And 'ere the sun was low,</span><br>
            With arms entwined, these lovers kind,<br>
            <span class="i1">Did down the vallies go.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>Said Jan, "Thou art a helpful lass,<br>
            <span class="i1">Wilt thou be mine for life?"</span><br>
            "For sure!" she said. To church they sped,<br>
            <span class="i1">And soon were man and wife.</span><br>
            A lesson then, for all young men<br>
            <span class="i1">Who would a courting go,</span><br>
            Your sweetheart ask to share your task,<br>
            <span class="i1">And thresh the Barley Stro'.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>Now many a year, this couple dear,<br>
            <span class="i1">They lived in harmony;</span><br>
            And children had, both lass and lad,<br>
            <span class="i1">I think 'twas thirty-three.</span><br>
            The sons so hale did wield the flail,<br>
            <span class="i1">And like their father grow;</span><br>
            The maidens sweet, like mother were neat:<br>
            <span class="i1">And clean as the Barley Stro'.</span></p>

        <p>As I walked out one day, one day,<br>
            All in the merry month of May,<br>
            When lambs did skip and thrushes sing,<br>
            And ev'ry bush with buds did spring.</p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>I met an old man by the way,<br>

            His coat was of the Myrtle-green,<br>
            But underneath his ribs were seen.</p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>He in his hand a glass did hold,<br>
            He shook as one that shakes with cold.<br>
            I asked of him what was his name,<br>
            And what strange place from which he came.</p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>"My name is Death, fair maiden, see<br>

            Your sand is run, you must away!"</p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>Alas! alack! the fair maid died,<br>
            And these the last sad words she cried:<br>
            "Here lies a poor, distressed maid,<br>

            <span class="i1">Which most men love dearly as life,</span><br>
            No relishsome food was a wanting<br>
            <span class="i1">But still—he was short of a wife.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>As Adam was resting in slumber,<br>
            <span class="i1">He lost a small rib from his side,</span><br>
            And when he awoke—'twas in wonder,<br>
            <span class="i1">To see a most beautiful bride.</span><br>
            In transport he gazèd upon her,<br>
            <span class="i1">His happiness now was complete.</span><br>
            He praisèd the bountiful Donor,<br>
            <span class="i1">Who to him had given a mate.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>She was not taken out of his head, sir,<br>
            <span class="i1">To rule and to triumph in man.</span><br>
            Nor was she took out of his foot, sir,<br>
            <span class="i1">By him to be trampled upon.</span><br>
            But she was took out of his side, sir,<br>
            <span class="i1">His equal co-partner to be;</span><br>
            So, united is man with his bride, sir,<br>
            <span class="i1">Yet man is the top of the tree.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>Then let not the fair be despisèd<br>
            <span class="i1">By man, as she's part of himself.</span><br>
            Let woman by man be a-prizèd<br>
            <span class="i1">As more than the world full of wealth.</span><br>
            A man without woman's a beggar,<br>
            <span class="i1">Tho' by him the world were possess'd</span><br>
            But a beggar that's got a good woman<br>
            <span class="i1">With more than the world is he bless'd.</span></p>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>I rode my little horse, from London town I came,<br>
            I rode into the country, to seek myself a dame,<br>
            And if I meet a pretty maid, be sure I'll kiss her then;<br>
            And swear that I will marry her—but will not tell her <i>when</i>!</p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>I found a buxom widow, with many tons of gold,<br>
            I lived upon her fortune, as long as it would hold.<br>
            Of pounds I took five hundred, bestrode my horse, and then,<br>
            I promised I would marry her—but never told her <i>when</i>!</p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>A vintner had a daughter, the Golden Sun his sign,<br>
            I tarried at his tavern, I drank his choicest wine;<br>
            I drank out all his cellar, bestrode my horse, and then,<br>
            I said the maid I'd marry,—but never told him <i>when</i>!</p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>The guineas are expended, the wine is also spent;<br>
            The widow and the maiden, they languish and lament.<br>
            And if they come to seek me, I'll pack them back again,<br>
            With promises of marriage,—but never tell them <i>when</i>.</p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>My little horse I mounted, the world that I might see,<br>
            I found a pretty maiden—as poor as poor could be.<br>
            My little horse neglected, to London ran away,<br>
            I asked if she would marry, and bade her name the day.</p>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>As I walked out one morn betime,<br>
            <span class="i1">To view the fields in May, Sir,</span><br>
            There I espied a fair sweet maid,<br>
            <span class="i1">Among the new-mown hay, Sir.</span><br>
            <span class="i4">Among the new-mown hay.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>I said: 'Good morning, pretty maid,<br>
            <span class="i1">How come you here so soon, say?'</span><br>
            'To keep my father's sheep,' she said,<br>
            <span class="i1">'A thing that must be done, aye!</span><br>
            <span class="i4">Among the new-mown hay.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>'While they be feeding mid the dew,<br>
            <span class="i1">To pass the time away, Sir!</span><br>
            I sit me down to knit and sew,<br>
            <span class="i1">Among the new-mown hay, Sir!</span><br>
            <span class="i4">Among the new-mown hay.'</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>I ask'd if she would wed with me,<br>
            <span class="i1">All on that sunny day, Sir!</span><br>
            The answer that she gave to me<br>
            <span class="i1">Was surely not a nay, Sir!</span><br>
            <span class="i4">Among the new-mown hay.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>Then to the church we sped with speed<br>
            <span class="i1">And Hymen join'd our hands, Sir!</span><br>
            No more the ewes and lambs she'll feed<br>
            <span class="i1">Since she did make her answer,</span><br>
            <span class="i4">Among the new-mown hay.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>A lord I be, a lady she,<br>
            <span class="i1">To town we sped straightway, Sir!</span><br>
            To bless the day, we both agree,<br>
            <span class="i1">We met among the hay, Sir!</span><br>

        <p>A story, a story, I'll tell you just now,<br>
            It's all about killing of Colly, my cow.<br>
            Ah! my pretty Colly, poor Colly, my cow!<br>

            Ah! my pretty Colly, &amp;c.</p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>Then cometh the Tripeman so trim and so neat,<br>
            He bids me three ha'pence for belly and feet;<br>
            Ah! my pretty Colly, &amp;c.</p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>Then cometh the Tanner with sword at his side,<br>

            Ah! my pretty Colly, &amp;c.</p>

        <p>Then cometh the Horner who roguery scorns,<br>

        <p>The skin of my Colly was softer than silk,<br>

        <p>Here's an end to my Colly, she's gone past recall,<br>

            I lovèd him well, and O! so very well<br>
            <span class="i2">I built him a nest in my breast.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>O since he is gone, I will let him alone,<br>

            If he loves a she far better than me,<br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>'Twas of a brisk young lady<br>
            <span class="i1">And of a 'prentice boy.</span><br>
            They courted one another,<br>
            <span class="i1">And he was all her joy;</span><br>
            The 'prentice boy was banish'd<br>
            <span class="i1">Unto a foreign shore,</span><br>
            And sad at heart he fancied<br>
            <span class="i1">He'd never see her more.</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>There came that way a squire<br>
            <span class="i1">A man of high degree,</span><br>
            Said he: 'I'll give you wages<br>
            <span class="i1">Be servant unto me.'</span><br>
            But oh! the fair young lady<br>
            <span class="i1">She piteously did cry</span><br>
            All for the love she bore him<br>
            <span class="i1">She thought that she must die.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>Now first he was in stable,<br>
            <span class="i1">With horses at the stall,</span><br>
            And then advanced to table,<br>
            <span class="i1">And servèd in the hall.</span><br>
            And next he was advancèd<br>
            <span class="i1">As butler to the same</span><br>
            And for his good behaviour<br>
            <span class="i1">A steward last became.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>O then into a lottery<br>
            <span class="i1">He put his money down,</span><br>
            He drew a prize and gainèd<br>
            <span class="i1">Full twenty thousand pound.</span><br>
            'Farewell, farewell my master!<br>
            <span class="i1">Farewell, my lady kind!</span><br>
            For I must seek my own true love<br>
            <span class="i1">That tarrieth behind.'</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>He dress'd himself in velvet,<br>
            <span class="i1">In gold and silver braid;</span><br>
            And so returned to England<br>
            <span class="i1">To his true love with speed.</span><br>
            And when he did espy her<br>
            <span class="i1">T'embrace her did essay,</span><br>
            But from his arms she started<br>
            <span class="i1">And frightened drew away.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>'Your gold and shining silver<br>
            <span class="i1">Your velvets I defy</span><br>
            I love a humble 'prentice<br>
            <span class="i1">I'll love him till I die.'</span><br>
            'O lady fair! my only,<br>
            <span class="i1">Return unto my arms.</span><br>
            I many years was banish'd<br>
            <span class="i1">And might not see your charms.'</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>Then closely she observed him,<br>
            <span class="i1">And knew him now again.</span><br>
            Her smiles dispelled her fears<br>
            <span class="i1">As sun disperseth rain.</span><br>
            With kisses out of measure<br>
            <span class="i1">She clasped him to her heart,</span><br>
            'O now we meet together,<br>
            <span class="i1">We never more shall, part.'</span></p>

        <p>In Bibberley town a maid did dwell,<br>
            A buxom lass, as I've heard tell;<br>
            As straight as a wand, just twenty two,<br>
            And many a bachelor had her in view.<br>
            <span class="i4">Ri fal de ral diddle, ri fal de ral dee,</span><br>
            <span class="i4">What ups and downs in the world there be!</span></p>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>This maid so beautiful fair and free,<br>
            Was sought by a squire of high degree;<br>
            He courted her honestly for his wife,<br>
            But she couldn't venture so high in life.<br>
            <span class="i4">Ri fal de ral &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>A tinker there came to mend the kettle,<br>
            She fell in love with the man of metal;<br>
            His songs and his jokes won her heart and her hand,<br>
            And she promised with him in the church to stand.<br>
            <span class="i4">Ri fal de ral &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>They wed, and this jovial mender of pots<br>
            Proved only a brute and the prince of sots;<br>
            He beat her, he starved her, she gave him the slip,<br>
            And back to Bibberley town did trip.<br>
            <span class="i4">Ri fal de ral &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>She found that the Squire her former flame<br>
            Had wooed and married a wealthy dame;<br>
            But a vacant place in the house she took,<br>
            And, instead of his wife, she became his cook.<br>

            And the same to you sergeant we made a reply,<br>
            There was nothing more spoken, we made to pass by.<br>
            <span class="i4">'Twas all on a Christmas day morning.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>Come! come my fine fellows, I pray you enlist,<br>
            Ten guineas in gold I will slap in your fist,<br>
            And a crown in the bargain to kick up a dust,<br>
            <span class="i4">For to drink the king's health in the morning.</span></p>

                class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

        <p>O, no! M<span class="super">r</span>. Sergeant, we are not for sale<br>
            We make no such bargain—your bribe won't avail,<br>
            Not tired of our country we care not to sail,<br>
            <span class="i4">Tho' your offers look pleasant and charming.</span></p>

                class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

        <p>Hah! if you insult me, without other words<br>
            I swear by the king we will draw out our swords,<br>
            And thrust thro' your bodies, as strength us affords,<br>
            <span class="i4">And leave you without further warning.</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>We beat the bold drummer as flat as his shoe,<br>
            We made a football of his row-de-dow-do,<br>
            And the sergeant and corporal, knocked down the two,<br>
            <span class="i4">O we were the boys in the morning.</span></p>

        <p class="center">8</p>

        <p>The two little weapons that hung at their side,<br>
            As we trotted away we threw into the tide,<br>
            May old Harry be with you, said Arthur Le Bride<br>
            <span class="i4">For staying our walk in the morning.</span></p>

        <p>O there was a keeper, a shooting did go,<br>
            And under his arm he did carry a bow,<br>
            And that for to bring down the buck and the doe;<br>

        <p>To the Queen of Hearts he's the Ace of sorrow,<br>
            He is here to-day, he is gone to-morrow;<br>
            Young men are plenty, but sweet-hearts few,<br>

            My eyes so full that I could not see.</p>

        <p>My father left me both house and land,<br>

        <p class="center">1</p>

        <p>On Monday morn I married a wife,<br>
            I thought to live a sober life.<br>
            As it fell out I were better dead,<br>
            Than mark the time when I was wed.<br>
            <span class="i4">Laddy-heigh-ho! Laddy-heigh-ho!</span><br>

        <p class="center">2</p>

        <p>On Tuesday morning to my surprise,<br>
            A little before the sun did rise,<br>
            She rattled her clapper, and scolded more,<br>
            Than ever I heard in my life before.<br>
            <span class="i4">Laddy-heigh-ho! &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">3</p>

        <p>On Wednesday morning I went to the wood,<br>
            I thought to do my wife some good.<br>
            I cut me a twig of holly green,<br>
            I trust the toughest I'd ever seen.<br>
            <span class="i4">Laddy-heigh-ho! &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">4</p>

        <p>I hung the stick up well to dry,<br>
            I thought on Thursday it to try,<br>
            I laid it about her head and back,<br>
            Before my twig began to crack.<br>
            <span class="i4">Laddy-heigh-ho! &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">5</p>

        <p>On Friday morning to my surprise,<br>
            A little before the sun did rise,<br>
            She rattled her clapper in scolding tone,<br>
            I turn'd my back and left her alone.<br>
            <span class="i4">Laddy-heigh-ho! &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">6</p>

        <p>On Saturday morn, as I may say,<br>
            As she on her pillow consulting lay,<br>
            A Bogie arrived in fume and flame,<br>
            And carried her off both blind and lame.<br>
            <span class="i4">Laddy-heigh-ho! &amp;c.</span></p>

        <p class="center">7</p>

        <p>On Sunday, neighbours, I dine without<br>
            A scolding wife and a brawling rout;<br>
            Enjoy my bottle, and my best friend,<br>
            And surely this is a brave week's end.<br>

    <span class="smcap">Chance it was</span>. Music and words dictated by James
    Parsons, hedger, Lew Down; he had learned it from his father, "The
    Singing Machine."</p>

<p>A second version of the melody was obtained from Bruce Tyndall, Esq.,
    of Exmouth, who had learned it from a Devonshire nurse in 1839 or
    1840. The melody was but a variant. It had lost the E<span title="natural">&#9838;</span> that
    comes in so pleasantly.</p>

<p>The tune was certainly originally in the Dorian mode, the E<span title="flat">&#9837;</span>
    being an alteration of a modern singer. We did not, however, feel
    justified in restoring the air to its early form, as we had no
    authority for so doing.</p>

<p>The words of the song are to be found in a collection of early ballad
    books in the British Museum, entitled "The Court of Apollo." There
    it consists of six verses, the first three of which are almost word
    for word the same as ours. In "The Songster's Favourite Companion," a
    later collection, the same song occurs. There it is in three verses
    only, and in a very corrupt form.</p>

<p>We are inclined to think that the song dates from the time of James
    I. or Charles I.</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_002"></a><a
        href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_2_THE_HUNTING_OF_ARSCOTT_OF_TETCOTT">2.</a>
    <span class="smcap">The Hunting of Arscott of Tetcott</span>. This song, once vastly
    popular in North Devon, and at all hunting dinners, is now nearly
    forgotten. The words have been published in "John Arscott of Tetcott"
    by Luke, Plymouth, <span class="sm">N.D.</span> A great many variations of the text
    exist. An early copy, dating from the end of the 18th century, was
    supplied me by R. Kelly, Esq., of Kelly; another by a gentleman,
    now dead, in his grandmother's handwriting (1820), with explanatory
    notes. The date given in the song varies; sometimes it is set down as
    1752, sometimes as 1772.</p>

<p>John Arscott, the last of his race, died in 1788. The "Sons of the
    Blue" are taken to have been Sir John Molesworth of Pencarrow, Bart.,
    William Morshead of Blisland, and Braddon Clode of Skisdon. But
    neither Sir John Molesworth nor Mr. Morshead was, as it happens, a
    naval man. If the date were either 1652 or 1672, it would fit John
    Arscott of Tetcott, who died in 1708, and Sir John Molesworth of
    Pencarrow, who was Vice-admiral of Cornwall; and the "Sons of the
    Blue" would be Hender, Sparke, and John, sons of Sir John. The second
    John Molesworth married Jane, daughter of John Arscott of Tetcott,
    in 1704. It seems probable, accordingly, that the song belonged
    originally to the elder John Arscott, and was adapted a century later
    to the last John Arscott. The date is not given with precision in the
    song; it is left vague as to the century—"In the year '52."</p>

<p>The author of the version of the song as now sung is said to have
    been one Dogget, who was wont to run after the foxhounds of the
    last Arscott. He probably followed the habit of all rural bards
    of adapting an earlier ballad to his purpose, and spoiling it in
    so doing. I think this, because along with much wretched stuff
    there occur traces of something better, and smacking of an earlier
    period. As Dogget's doggerel has been printed, and as I have taken
    down a dozen variants, I have retained only what I deemed worthy of
    retention, and have entirely recast the conclusion of the song.</p>

<p>John Arscott is still believed to hunt the country, and there are men
    alive who declare positively that they have seen him and his hounds
    go by, and have heard the winding of his horn, at night, in the park
    at Tetcott.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank Abbott, gamekeeper at Pencarrow, but born at Tetcott,
    informed me, concerning Dogget: "Once they unkennelled in the
    immediate neighbourhood of Tetcott, and killed at Hatherleigh. This
    runner was in at the death, as was his wont. John Arscott ordered him
    a bed at Hatherleigh, but to his astonishment, when he returned to
    Tetcott, his wife told him all the particulars of the run. 'Then,'
    said Arscott, 'this must be the doing of none other than Dogget;
    where is he?' Dogget was soon found in the servants' hall, drinking
    ale, having outstripped his master and run all the way home."</p>

<p>In the MS. copy of 1820, the names of the "Sons of the Blue" were Bob
    (Robt. Dennis of S. Breock), Bill (Bill Tickell), and Britannia (Sir
    J. Molesworth). The tune, which is in the Æolian mode, was obtained
    through the assistance of Mr. W.C. Richards, schoolmaster at Tetcott.
    We also had it from John Benney, labourer, Menheniot.</p>

<p>Mr. Richards writes:—"This song is sung annually at the Rent-audit
    of the Molesworth estate at Tetcott. Thirty years ago an old man
    sang it, and the version I send you is as near the original, as sung
    by him, as can be secured. Workmen on the estate often hum the air,
    and always sing it at their annual treats." The Arscott property at
    Tetcott passed by inheritance to the Molesworths.</p>

<p>Half of the tune was employed by D'Urfey, a Devonshire man, in his
    "Pills to Purge Melancholy," to the words, "Dear Catholic Brother"
    (vi. p. 277, ed. 1719-20). From D'Urfey it passed into the "Musical
    Miscellany," 1731, vi. p. 171, to the words, "Come take up your
    Burden, ye Dogs, and away." From England the same half-tune was
    carried into Wales, and Jones, in his "Musical Relicks of the Welsh
    Bards," 1794, i. p. 129, gives it set to the words of "Difarwch gwyn
    Dyfl."</p>

        class="smcap">Upon a Sunday Morning.</span> The melody taken down from Robert
    Hard, South Brent. This is the song to which reference has been made
    in the Introduction. It is not a genuine folk melody, but it is an
    interesting example of the way in which the folk muse reshapes an air.</p>

<p>Hard sang the words of Charles Swan—</p>

        <p>"'Twas on a Sunday morning, before the bells did peal,<br>
            A note came through the window, with Cupid as the seal."
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>These words were set to music by Francis Mori in 1853. I give Mori's
    tune, and advise that with it should be compared Hard's variation of
    it. I have written fresh words to this variation—</p>

        class="smcap">The Trees they are so High.</span> Words and melody taken down
    in 1888 first from James Parsons, then from Matthew Baker. Again
    in 1891 from Richard Broad, aged 71, of Herodsfoot, near S. Keyne,
    Cornwall. Again, the words, to a different air, from Roger Hannaford.
    Another version from William Aggett, a paralysed labourer of 70
    years, at Chagford. Mr. Sharp has also obtained it in Somersetshire.
    A fragment was sung at the Folk-Song Competition at Frome in April
    1904. Mr. Kidson has noted a version in Yorkshire, Miss Broadwood
    another in Surrey, see <i>Folk-Song Journal</i>, vol. i. p. 214.
    Apparently there exist two distinct variants of the ballad, each to
    its proper melody.</p>

<p>Johnson, in his "Museum," professed to give a Scottish version—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"O Lady Mary Ann looks owre the Castle wa',<br>
            She saw three bonny boys playing at the ba',<br>
            The youngest he was the flower among them a';<br>
            <span class="i2">My bonny laddie's young, but he's growing yet."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>But of his version only three of the stanzas are genuine, and they
    are inverted; the rest are a modern composition.</p>

<p>A more genuine Scottish form is in Maidment's "North Country
    Garland," Edinburgh, 1874; but there the young man is fictitiously
    converted into a Laird of Craigstoun. It begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Father, said she, you have done me wrong,<br>
            For ye have married me on a childe young man,<br>
            <span class="i2">And my bonny love is long</span><br>
            <span class="i2">Agrowing, growing, deary,</span><br>
            <span class="i2">Growing, growing, said the bonny maid."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>But the most genuine form is on an Aberdeen Broadside, B.M., 1871, f.
    This, the real Scottish ballad, has verses not in the English, and
    the English ballad has a verse or two not in the Scottish.</p>

<p>I have received an Irish version as sung in Co. Tipperary; it is in
    six verses, but that about the "Trees so High" is lacking. The rhyme
    is more correct than that of any of the printed versions, and the
    lines run in triplets. One verse is—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"O Father, dear Father, I'll tell you what we'll do,<br>
            We'll send him off to college for another year or two,<br>
            And we'll tie round his college cap a ribbon of the blue,<br>
            <span class="i2">To let the maidens know he is married."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>In one of the versions I have taken down (Hannaford's and Aggett's)
    there were traces of the triplet very distinct, and the tune was
    akin to the Irish melody sent me, as sung by Mary O'Bryan, Cahir,
    Tipperary. Portions of the ballad have been forced into that of "The
    Cruel Mother" in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N3" id="Page_N3">-N3-</a></span> Motherwell's MS., Child's

    Ballads," i. p. 223. In this a mother gives birth to three sons at
    once and murders them; but after they are murdered—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"She lookit over her father's wa',<br>
            And saw three bonnie boys playing at the ba'."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Our melody is in the Phrygian mode, a scale which is extremely
    scarce in English folk-song. The only other example we know is in
    Ducoudray's book of the "Folk Melodies of Brittany."</p>

<p>The Scotch have two airs, one in Johnson's "Museum," the other in
    "The British Minstrel," Glasgow, 1844, vol. ii. p. 36, both totally
    distinct from ours.</p>

<p>That the ballad is English and not originally Scotch is probable, for
    Fletcher quotes it in "The Two Noble Kinsmen," 1634. He makes the
    crazy jailer's daughter sing us a snatch of an old ballad—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"For I'll cut my green coat, a foot above my knee,<br>
            And I'll clip my yellow locks, an inch below my eye,<br>
            <span class="i2">Hey ninny, ninny, ninny;</span><br>
            He's buy me a white cut (stick) forth for to ride,<br>
            And I'll go seek him, through the world that is so wide,<br>
            <span class="i2">Hey ninny, ninny, ninny."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>In the ballad as taken down from Aggett—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"I'll cut my yellow hair away by the root,<br>
            And I will clothe myself all in a boy's suit,<br>
            And to the college high, I will go afoot."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>I have had versions also from Mary Langworthy, Stoke Flemming, in
    the Hypodorian mode, and from W.S. Vance, Penarth, as sung by an old
    woman at Padstow in 1863, now dead.</p>

<p>Mr. Sharp gives a version in "Folk Songs from Somerset," No. 15.</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_005"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_5_PARSON_HOGG">5.</a>
    <span class="smcap">Parson Hogg</span>. This was sung by my great-uncle, Thomas
    Snow, Esq., of Franklyn, near Exeter, when I was a child. I have
    received it also from Mr. H. Whitfeld, brushmaker, Plymouth. The
    words may be found, not quite the same, but substantially so, in "The
    New Cabinet of Love," <i>circ.</i> 1810, as "Doctor Mack." In Oliver's
    "Comic Songs," <i>circ.</i> 1815, it is "Parson Ogg, the Cornish Vicar."
    It is also in "The Universal Songster" (1826), ii. p. 348. It is
    found on Broadsides.</p>

    <span class="smcap">Cold blows the Wind</span>. The words originally reached me as
    taken down by the late Mrs. Gibbons, daughter of Sir W.L. Trelawney,
    Bart., from an old woman, who, in 1830, was nurse in her father's
    house. Since then we have heard it repeatedly, indeed there are few
    old singers who do not know it. There are two melodies to which it is
    sung, that we give here, and that to which "Childe the Hunter" is set
    in this collection. The ballad is always in a fragmentary condition.
    The ballad, under the title of "The Unquiet Grave," is in Professor
    Child's "British Ballads," No. 78. He gives various forms of it. The
    idea on which it is based is that if a woman has plighted her oath
    to a man, she is still bound to him, after he is dead, and that he
    can claim her to follow him into the world of spirits, unless she can
    redeem herself by solving riddles he sets her. See further on this
    topic under "The Lover's Tasks," <a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_48_THE_LOVERS_TASKS">No. 48</a>. Verses 8
    and 10 are not in
    the original ballad. I have supplied them to reduce the length and
    give a conclusion.</p>

        class="smcap">The Sprig of Thyme</span>. Taken down from James Parsons. After
    the second verse he broke away into "The Seeds of Love." Joseph Dyer,
    of Mawgan in Pyder, sang the same ballad or song to the same tune,
    and in what I believe to be the complete form of words—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"O once I had plenty of thyme,<br>
            It would flourish by night and by day,<br>
            Till a saucy lad came, return'd from the sea,<br>
            And stole my thyme away.<br>
            <br>
            "O and I was a damsel fair,<br>
            But fairer I wish't to appear;<br>
            So I wash'd me in milk, and I clothed me in silk,<br>
            And put the sweet thyme in my hair.<br>
            <br>
            "With June is the red rose in bud,<br>
            But that was no flower for me,<br>
            I plucked the bud, and it prick'd me to blood,<br>
            And I gazed on the willow tree.<br>
            <br>
            "O the willow tree it will twist,<br>
            And the willow tree it will twine,<br>
            I would I were fast in my lover's arms clasp't,<br>
            For 'tis he that has stolen my thyme.<br>
            <br>
            "O it's very good drinking of ale,<br>
            But it's better far drinking of wine,<br>

<p>The song, running as it does on the same theme and in the same metre
    as "The Seeds of Love," is very generally mixed up with it, and Miss
    Broadwood calls her version of it, in "English County Songs," p. 58,
    "The Seeds of Love, <i>or</i> The Sprig of Thyme." The "Seeds of Love"
    is attributed by Dr. Whittaker, in his "History of Whalley," to
    Mrs. Fleetwood Habergham, who died in 1703. He says: "Ruined by the
    extravagance and disgraced by the vices of her husband, she soothed
    her sorrows by some stanzas yet remembered among the old people of
    her neighbourhood." See "The New Lover's Garland," B.M. (11,621, b
    6); a Northumbrian version in "Northumbrian Minstrelsy," 1882, p.
    90; a Scottish version in "Albyn's Anthology," 1816, i. p. 40; a
    Somersetshire in "Folk Songs from Somerset," No. 1; a Yorkshire in
    Kidson's "Traditional Tunes," p. 69. As the two songs are so mixed up
    together, I have thought it best to re-write the song.</p>

<p>The melody was almost certainly originally in the Æolian mode, but
    has got altered.</p>

    <span class="smcap">Roving Jack</span>. Taken down, words and melody, from William
    Aggett, Chagford, and from James Parsons, Lew Down. An inferior
    version of the words is to be found among Catnach's Broadsheets,
    Ballads, B.M. (1162, b, vol. vii.), also one printed in Edinburgh,
    Ballads (1750-1840), B.M. (1871, f). Note what has been said relative
    to this tune, which is in the Æolian mode, under <a

    Words taken down from Jonas Coaker, aged
    85, and blind. The melody was given us by Mr. John Webb, who had
    heard him sing it in former years. Another version to the same air
    was obtained from North Tawton. Again, another was given me by the
    Hon. A.F. Northcote, who took it down in 1877 from an itinerant
    pedlar of 90 years at Buckingham.</p>

<p>The words and tune were clearly composed at the time of the
    Commonwealth, 1649-1661.</p>

    Words and melody taken down from John
    Woodrich, blacksmith; he learned both from his grandmother when he
    was a child. The Hon. J.S. Northcote sent me another version taken
    down from an old woman at Upton Pyne. Again, another from Mr. James
    Ellis of Chaddlehanger, Lamerton; another from Bruce Tyndall, Esq.,
    of Exmouth, as taken down from a Devonshire cook in 1839 or 1840.
    This, the same melody as that from Upton Pyne. Woodrich's tune is the
    brightest, the other the oldest. The same ballad to different tune
    in "Northumbrian Minstrelsy," 1882, p. 98. The song is in D'Urfey's
    "Pills to Purge Melancholy," 1720, vi. p. 100, in 14 verses, with a
    different conclusion. Broadside versions by Disley and Such. Also
    in "The Broom Man's Garland," in "LXXXII. Old Ballads" collected by
    J. Bell, B.M. (11,621, c 2). Bell was librarian to the Society of
    Antiquaries, Newcastle-on-Tyne, 1810-20. Mr. Kidson has obtained a
    version in North Yorkshire. Another is in "English County Songs," p.
    88. In "Gammer Gurton's Garland," <i>circ.</i> 1783, are three verses.</p>

        class="smcap">As Johnny Walked Out</span>. Words and melody from James
    Parsons. The original words are in six stanzas, and these I have
    compressed. The words with some verbal differences as "set by Mr.
    Dunn" are in "Six English Songs and Dialogues, as they are performed
    in the Public Gardens," <span class="sm">N.D.</span>, but about 1750. Then in <i>The London
        Magazine</i>, 1754; in "Apollo's Cabinet," Liverpool, 1757; in "Clio
    and Euterpe," London, 1758. Our melody was obtained also by Mr. T.S.
    Cayzer, at Post Bridge, in 1849, and we have taken down four or five
    versions. The tune is totally different from that by "Mr. Dunn."</p>

        class="smcap">The Miller and his Sons</span>. Taken down, music and words,

    Collection, iii. p. 681. It is included in Bell's "Songs of the
    English Peasantry," p. 194; and is in the "Northumbrian Minstrelsy,"
    Newcastle, 1882. In the North of England it is sung to the air
    of "The Oxfordshire Tragedy," Chappell, p. 191. Our air bears no
    resemblance to this.</p>

        class="smcap">Ormond the Brave</span>. This very interesting Ballad was
    taken down, words and music, from J. Peake, tanner, Liskeard; it was
    sung by his father about 1830. It refers to the Duke of Ormond's
    landing in Devon in 1714. Ormond fled to France in the first days of
    July, "a duke without a duchy," as Lord Oxford termed him, when it
    was manifest that the country was resolved on having the Hanoverian
    Elector as King, and was unwilling to summon the Chevalier of St.
    George to the throne. At the end of October the Duke of Ormond landed
    in Devon at the head of a few men, hoping that the West would rise in
    the Jacobite cause, but not a single adherent joined his standard,
    and he returned to France. The Devonshire squires were ready to
    plant Scotch pines in token of their Jacobite sympathies, but not to
    jeopardise their heads and acres in behalf of a cause which their
    good sense told them was hopeless. I have met with the ballad in a
    Garland, B.M. (11,621, b 16). This, however, is imperfect. It runs
    thus—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"I am Ormond the brave, did you ever hear of me?<br>
            Who lately was banished from my own country.<br>
            They sought for my life and plundered my estate,<br>
            For being so loyal to Queen Anne the Great.<br>
            <span class="i2">I am Ormond, etc.</span><br>
            <br>
            "Says Ormond, If I did go, with Berwick I stood,<br>
            And for the Crown of England I ventured my blood,<br>
            To the Boyne I advanced, to Tingney (Quesnoy?) also,<br>
            I preserved King William from Berwick his foe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N5" id="Page_N5">-N5-</a></span><br>
            <br>
            "I never sold my country as cut-purses do,<br>
            Nor never wronged my soldiers of what was their due.<br>
            Such laws I do hate, you're witness above,<br>
            I left my estate for the country I love.<br>
            <br>
            "Although they degrade me, I value it not a straw,<br>
            Some call me Jemmy Butler, I'm Ormond you know.<br>
            <span class="i2">(<i>Rest of verse missing.</i>)</span><br>
            <br>
            "But in the latter days our late Mistress Anne,<br>
            Disprove my loyalty if you can,<br>
            I was Queen Anne's darling, old England's delight,<br>
            Sacheverel's friend, and Fanatic's spite."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>When Peake sang the song to Mr. Sheppard and me, he converted German
    Elector into German lecturers.</p>

<p>The impeachment and attainder of the Duke in 1715 was a cruel and
    malicious act. When he was in the Netherlands acting in concert with
    Prince Eugene, he was hindered from prosecuting the war by secret
    instructions from Queen Anne. When Quesnoy was on the point of
    capitulating, he was forced to withdraw, as he had received orders to
    proclaim a cessation of arms for two months. After the death of Queen
    Anne, the new Whig Ministry was resolved on his destruction, and
    he fled to France, where, although he had been loyal to William of
    Orange, and had fought under him at the Boyne, and had also been one
    of the first to welcome George I., he threw himself into the cause
    of the Pretender, in a fit of resentment at the treatment he had
    received. He died on 16th November 1745 at Avignon, but his body was
    brought to England and buried in Henry VII.'s Chapel, Westminster.
    Swift, writing in the hour of his persecution, gives his character
    at great length. "The attainder," says he, "now it is done, looks
    like a dream to those who will consider the nobleness of his birth;
    the great merits of his ancestors, and his own; his long, unspotted
    loyalty; his affability, generosity, and sweetness of nature.... I
    have not conversed with a more faultless person; of great justice and
    charity; a true sense of religion, without ostentation; of undoubted
    valour; thoroughly skilled in his trade of a soldier; a quick and
    ready apprehension; with a good share of understanding, and a general
    knowledge of men and history."</p>

<p>Mackay, in his "Characters of the Court of Great Britain," says of
    him when Governor in Ireland:—"He governs in Ireland with more
    affection from the people, and his court is in the greatest splendour
    ever known in that country. He certainly is one of the most generous,
    princely, brave men that ever was, but good-natured to a fault."</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_014"></a><a
        href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_14_SIR_JOHN_BARLEYCORN">14.</a> <span
        class="smcap">John Barleycorn</span>. This famous old song has gone through
    several recastings. The earliest known copy is of the age of James
    I. in the Pepysian Collection, i. 426, printed in black letter by
    H. Gosson (1607-1641). Other copies of Charles II.'s reign in the
    same Collection, i. 470, and the Ewing Collection, by the publishers
    Clarke, Thackeray, and Passenger, to the tune of "Shall I lye beyond
    thee." Chappell concludes that this was a very early ballad. "The
    language is not that of London and its neighbourhood during James's
    reign. It is either northern dialect—which, according to Puttenham,
    would commence about 60 miles from London—or it is much older than
    the date of the printers," Roxburgh Ballads, ii. p. 327.</p>

<p>This ballad begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"As I went through the North Country<br>
            <span class="i2">I heard a merry greeting,</span><br>
            A pleasant toy and full of joy—<br>
            <span class="i2">Two noblemen were meeting."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>These two noblemen are Sir John Barleycorn and Thomas Goodale.</p>

<p>The sixth verse runs—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Sir John Barlycorne fought in a boule<br>
            <span class="i2">Who wonne the victorie,</span><br>
            And made them all to fume and sweare<br>
            <span class="i2">That Barlycorne should die.</span><br>
            <br>
            "Some said kill him, some said drowne,<br>
            <span class="i2">Others wisht to hang him hie;</span><br>
            For as many as follow Barlycorne<br>
            <span class="i2">Shall surely beggars die.</span><br>
            <br>
            "Then with a plough they plow'd him up,<br>
            <span class="i2">And thus they did devise,</span><br>
            To burie him quicke within the earth,<br>
            <span class="i2">And sware he should not rise.</span><br>
            <br>
            "With harrowes strong they combèd him<br>
            <span class="i2">And burst clods on his head,</span><br>
            A joyfull banquet then they made<br>
            <span class="i2">When Barlycorne was dead."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Then the ballad runs on the same as ours. Burns got hold of this
    ballad, and tinkered it up into the shape in which it appears in his
    collected works, altering some expressions, and adding about six
    stanzas. He in no way improved it. Jameson, in his "Popular Ballads,"
    Edinburgh, 1806, tells us that he had heard it sung in Morayshire
    before that Burns' songs were published.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N6" id="Page_N6">-N6-</a></span></p>

<p>Dixon, in his collection of the "Songs of the English Peasantry,"
    1846, says that "John Barleycorn" was sung throughout England to the
    tune of "Stingo, or Oil of Barley," which may be found in Chappell,
    from the "Dancing Master," in which it occurs from 1650 to 1690.
    But this is not the air to which it is set in the Broadsides above
    referred to, nor is it that to which it is sung in the West of
    England.</p>

<p>Dr. Barrett has given a different "John Barleycorn" in his "English
    Folk-Songs," and another is in the <i>Folk-Song Journal</i>, vol. i. p. 81.</p>

<p>The words as now sung may be found in "The Mountain of Hair Garland,"
    B.M. (1162, c 4), <i>circ.</i> 1760. It is also among Such's broadsides.
    Words and air were taken down by Mr. Bussell, from James Mortimore, a
    cripple, at Princetown, in 1890.</p>

<p>A version taken down in Sussex, to a different tune, is seen in the
    <i>Folk-Song Journal</i>. This begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"There were three men came out of the West,<br>
            <span class="i1">They sold their wheat for rye;</span><br>
            They made an oath and a solemn oath,<br>
            <span class="i1">John Barleycorn should die."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>One verse is not in our version—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"And in the mash-tub he was put,<br>
            <span class="i1">And they scalded him stark blind.</span><br>
            And then they served him worse than that<br>
            <span class="i1">They cast him to the swine."</span></p>

    The singers were four Cornish miners, who were at that time, 1854,
    employed at some lead mines near the town of Zell. The leader,
    or captain, John Stocker, said that the song was an established
    favourite with the miners of Cornwall and Devonshire, and was always
    sung on the pay-days and at the wakes; and that his grandfather, who
    died thirty years before, at the age of a hundred years, used to
    sing the song, and say it was very old. The tune is plaintive and
    original." Unfortunately Mr. Bell does not give the tune. The air
    was first sent me by E.F. Stevens, Esq., of the Terrace, St. Ives,
    who wrote that the melody "had run in his head any time these eight
    and thirty years." We have since had it from a good many old men in
    Cornwall, and always to the same air. They assert that it is a duet,
    and was so set in our first edition.</p>

<p>Mr. Bell did not know much of the subject, or he would have been
    aware that so far from the song being of the 17th century, it was
    composed by Bickerstaff for "Thomas and Sally" in 1760, and was set
    to music by Dr. Arne. I have, however, adopted Bell's words instead
    of those of Bickerstaff, as shorter. The Cornish melody is quite
    distinct from that by Arne, and is not earlier or later than the
    second half of the 18th century.</p>

        class="smcap">Widdecombe Fair</span>. At present the best known and most
    popular of Devonshire songs, though the melody is without particular
    merit. The original "Uncle Tom Cobley" lived in a house near Yeoford
    Junction, in the parish of Spreyton. His will was signed on January
    20, 1787, and was proved on March 14, 1794. He was a genial old
    bachelor. Mr. Samuel Peach, his oldest relation living, tells me, "My
    great-uncle, who succeeded him, with whom I lived for some years,
    died in 1843, over eighty years of age; he married, but left no
    children." We have obtained numerous variants of the air, one taken
    down from R. Bickle, Two Bridges, is an early form of the melody; but
    as that we give is familiar to most Devonshire men, we have retained
    it. The names in the chorus all belonged to residents at Sticklepath.</p>

<p>Mr. C. Sharp has taken down a variant as "Midsummer Fair" in
    Somersetshire. The words so far as they went were the same, but each
    verse ended in a jingle instead of names.</p>

        class="smcap">Ye Maidens Pretty</span>. The words and melody from James
    Parsons. The fullest Broadside version, but very corrupt, is one
    published at Aberdeen, Ballads, B.M. (1871, f, p. 61); another,
    shorter, by Williams of Portsea. In both great confusion has been
    made by some ignorant poetaster in enlarging and altering, so that
    in many of the verses the rhymes have been lost. This is how the
    Aberdeen Broadside copy begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"You maidens pretty<br>
            In country and city<br>
            With pity hear,<br>
            <span class="i2">My mournful tale;</span><br>
            A maid confounded,<br>
            In sorrow drownded,<br>
            And deeply wounded,<br>
            <span class="i2">With grief and pain."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>In the third line the "pity" has got misplaced, and "sad complain"
    has been turned into "mournful tale," to the loss of the rhyme. Verse
    4 has fared even worse. It runs—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"My hardened parents<br>
            Gave special order<br>
            That I should be<br>

            Or lest that I<br>
            <span class="i2">Should my darling see."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>A parody on the song was written by Ashley, of Bath, and sung in
    "Bombastes Furioso," Rhodes' burlesque, in 1810, to the Irish tune of
    "Paddy O'Carrol." This appears also in "The London Warbler," 3 vols.,
    <span class="sm">N.D.</span>, but about 1826, vol. i. p. 80—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"My love is so pretty, so gay, and so witty,<br>
            All in town, court, and city, to her must give place.<br>
            My Lord on the woolsack, his coachman did pull back,<br>
            To have a look, full smack, at her pretty face," etc.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>A Catnach Broadside, "The Cruel Father and the Affectionate Lovers,"
    is a new version of the original ballad. Words and melody are
    probably of the Elizabethan age; an air to which this ballad has
    been recovered from tradition in Surrey resembles ours, and is a
    corruption of the earlier melody.</p>

<p>The ballad goes back to a remote antiquity. The French have it, a
    "complainte romanesque," of which Tiersot says: "It was known in
    past ages, as is shown by a semi-literary imitation, published in a
    song-book of the beginning of the 17th century. And in our own day,
    poets and literary men, such as Gerard de Nerval, Prosper Mérimée,
    M. Auguste Vitu, have given their names to it, having picked it up
    as a precious thing from oral recitations by the peasants of our
    provinces." It is the ballad of a princess loving a knight, "<span lang="fr">qu' n'a
pas vaillant six deniers</span>." The King Loys, her father, has imprisoned
    her in the highest of his towers—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"<span lang="fr">Elle y fut bien sept ans passés<br>
Sans qu' son pèr' vint la visiter;<br>
Et quand l'y eut sept ans passés</span>,<br>
            <span class="i2"><span lang="fr">Son père la fut visiter</span>."—<span class="smcap">Tiersot</span>, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 20.</span>
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>There can, I think, be no doubt that it is an old troubadour lay
    which has been re-composed in Elizabethan times, and has since been
    somewhat degraded.</p>

        class="smcap">The Silly Old Man</span>. A ballad that was sung by the late
    Rev. G. Luscombe something over half a century ago. He was curate of
    Bickleigh, and by ancestry belonged to a good old Devonshire family,
    and he was particularly fond of ancient West of England songs.
    Another version, from old Suey Stephens, a charwoman at Stowford;
    another, as sung in 1848, received from Dr. Reed in Tiverton. Miss
    Mason, in her "Nursery Rhymes and Country Songs," 1877, gives a
    slight variant, also from Devonshire.</p>

<p>The ballad is in Dixon's "Songs of the English Peasantry," 1846,
    as taken down by him from oral recitation in Yorkshire in 1845.
    It exists in a chap-book, under the title of "The Crafty Farmer,"
    published in 1796. In Yorkshire the song goes by the name of "Saddle
    to Rags"; there, and elsewhere in the North of England, it is sung to
    the tune of "The Rant," better known as "How happy could I be with
    either." It has been published as a Scottish ballad in Maidment's
    "Ballads and Songs," Edinburgh, 1859. It is given in Kidson's
    "Traditional Tunes." The words also in "A Pedlar's Pack," by Logan,
    Edinburgh, 1849. The tune to which this ballad is sung in Devonshire
    is quite distinct.</p>

        class="smcap">The Months of the Year</span>. Still a popular song among farm
    labourers. Three versions of the air and words were taken down—one
    at South Brent, one at Belstone, one at Post Bridge. The air is
    clearly an old dance tune. The version we preferred was that given us
    by J. Potter, farmer, of Merripit, Post Bridge. For like songs, see
    "English County Songs," p. 143, and Barrett's "Folk-Songs." Barrett
    has the same air as ours, but in triple time. That a similar song
    should be found on the Continent is not wonderful; see "<span lang="fr">Les Douze
Mois de l'année</span>" in Coussemaker: "<span lang="fr">Les Flamands de France</span>," p. 133.</p>

        class="smcap">The Chimney Sweep</span>. Taken down from J. Helmore, miller,
    South Brent. The first verse occurs in one of James Catnach's
    chap-books: "The Cries of London," <i>circ.</i> 1815.</p>

<p>The tune is possibly based on one used by the Savoyard sweeps, for
    Tiersot refers to one such: "<span lang="fr">Avec sa bizarre vocalise descendante,
d'un accent si étrange dans sa rudesse montagnarde</span>—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"<span lang="fr">Ramonez-ci, ramonez-là,<br>
<span class="i1">Sh-a-a-a-ah</span><br>

    </div>
</div>

<p>And this corresponds with the passage, "Aye and there," with its
    curious descent in our tune: Tiersot, "<span lang="fr">Hist. de la Chanson Populaire
en France</span>," Paris, 1889, p. 143.</p>

    Parsons. A Broadside with a different ending printed by Disley,
    Pitts, Such &amp; Hodges. Also Tozer's "Forty Sailors' Songs," Boosey,
    No. 33. The usual air to which this song is sung in Devon is of a
    much earlier character; but we give this as more agreeable to modern
    ears. Barrett gives the song in his "English Folk-Songs," No. 32, to
    a different tune.</p>

    Taken down, words and music, from John
    Woodrich, blacksmith. Muslin was introduced into England in 1670, and
    cork in 1690. Both are spoken of as novelties, and muslin is sung to
    the old form of the word, mous-el-ine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N8" id="Page_N8">-N8-</a></span></p>

<p>Miss F. Crossing sent me another version of the words, taken down
    from an old woman in South Devon, in or about 1850—</p>

<div class="center">

        <p>"'My man John, what can the matter be?'<br>

<p>Another version comes from Yorkshire ("Halliwell Nursery Rhymes," 4th

        class="smcap">The Death of Parker</span>. Words and melody taken down from
    Samuel Fone, mason, Blackdown. It is identical with one obtained
    in Yorkshire by Mr. Kidson. "The Death of Parker" is found on
    Broadsides, and is in "The Lover's Harmony," <span class="sm">N.D.</span>, printed by Pitts,
    of Seven Dials. It is in Logan's "Pedlar's Pack," p. 58, and in
    Ashton's "Modern Street Ballads," London, 1888, p. 218.</p>

<p>On April 15, 1797, when Admiral Bridport, commanding the
    line-of-battle ships at Portsmouth and Spithead, signalled for the
    fleet to prepare for sea, the men, by a preconcerted agreement,
    refused to raise anchors till they had obtained redress for their
    grievances, which had been sent in the form of a petition to Lord
    Howe, two months before, and which had remained unnoticed. The Lords
    of the Admiralty endeavoured for some days, but ineffectually, to
    reduce the men to obedience. At last the grievances complained of
    were redressed by the action of Lord Bridport, who also obtained his
    Majesty's pardon for the offenders. However, in May, the sailors
    at Portsmouth, thinking that the Government did not intend to keep
    faith with them, came ashore and committed great excesses. Shortly
    after this the fleet at Sheerness exhibited a mutinous spirit, and
    this broke out into open mutiny at the Nore. At the head of the men
    was Richard Parker, a Devonshire man. The obnoxious officers were
    sent ashore, and the red flag was hoisted. Altogether twenty-five
    ships were included in the mutiny. The mutineers seized certain
    store-ships, fired on some frigates that were about to put to sea,
    and blockaded the mouth of the Thames. All attempts at conciliation
    having failed, it became necessary to resort to stringent measures.
    Ships and gunboats were armed, batteries were erected on shore; the
    mutineers were prevented from landing to obtain fresh water and
    provisions; and all buoys and beacons were removed, so as to render
    egress from the Thames impossible. One by one the ships engaged in
    the mutiny began to drop off, and at last the <i>Sandwich</i>, Parker's
    flagship, ran in under the batteries and delivered up the ringleader.
    Parker was hung at the yard-arm on June 30. The ballad was composed
    at the time, and obtained a wide circulation by appearing on
    Broadsides.</p>

<p>At the Exeter Assizes in 1828, John C. Parker, son of Richard Parker,
    obtained a verdict against his aunts for the possession of an estate
    called Shute, which had belonged to his father's elder brother. The
    question turned upon the legitimacy of the plaintiff, which was
    proved by his mother, a woman who exhibited the remains of uncommon
    beauty, and who was a Scottish woman, married to Richard Parker in
    1793.</p>

    <span class="smcap">The Helston Furry Dance</span>. On May 8, annually, a festival
    is held at Helston, in Cornwall, to celebrate the incoming of spring.
    Very early in the morning a party of youths and maidens go into the
    country, and return dancing through the streets to a quaint tune,
    peculiar to the day, called the "Furry Dance." At eight o'clock the
    "Hal-an-tow" is sung by a party of from twenty to thirty men and
    boys who come into the town bearing green branches, with flowers
    in their hats, preceded by a single drum, on which a boy beats the
    Furry Dance. They perambulate the town for many hours, stopping at
    intervals at some of the principal houses.</p>

<p>At one o'clock a large party of ladies and gentlemen, in summer
    attire—the ladies decorated with garlands of flowers, the gentlemen
    with nosegays and flowers in their hats, assemble at the Town Hall,
    and proceed to dance after the band, playing the traditional air.
    They first trip in couples, hand in hand, during the first part
    of the tune, forming a string of from thirty to forty couples, or
    perhaps more; at the second part of the tune the first gentleman
    turns with both hands the lady behind him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N9" id="Page_N9">-N9-</a></span> and
    her partner turns
    in like manner with the first lady; then each gentleman turns his
    own partner, and then they trip on as before. The other couples, of
    course, pair and turn in the same way, and at the same time.</p>

<p>The dancing is not confined to the streets; the house doors are
    thrown open, and the train of dancers enters by the front, dances
    through the house, and out at the back, through the garden, and back
    again. It is considered a slight to omit a house. Finally the train
    enters the Assembly Room and there resolves itself into an ordinary
    waltz.</p>

<p>As soon as the first party is finished, another goes through the same
    evolutions, and then another, and so on, and it is not till late at
    night that the town returns to its peaceful propriety.</p>

<p>There is a general holiday in the town on Flora Day, and so strictly
    was this formerly adhered to, that anyone found working on that day
    was compelled to jump across Pengella, a wide stream that discharges
    its waters into Loo Pool. As this feat was almost impracticable,
    it involved a sousing. The festival has by no means ceased to be
    observed; it has rather, of late years, been revived in energetic
    observance.</p>

<p>The "Helston Furry Dance" is a relic of part of the Old English May
    Games. These originally comprised four entirely distinct parts.
    1st. The election and procession of the King and Queen of the May,
    who were called the Summer King and Queen. 2nd. The Morris Dance,
    performed by men disguised, with swords in their hands. 3rd. The
    "Hobby Horse." 4th. The "Robin Hood."</p>

<p>In the Helston performance we have a fragment only of the original
    series of pageants; at Padstow the Hobby-horse still figures. I have
    given the two Padstow songs in "A Garland of Country Song," 1895, No.
    42.</p>

<p>The Helston Furry Dance tune was printed in Davies Gilbert's
    "Christmas Carols," 2nd ed., 1823. His form is purer than ours, which
    is as now sung. Edward Jones had already published it in his "Bardic
    Museum," vol. ii. (1802) as "The Cornish May Song," and George
    Johnson in his "Welsh Airs," vol. ii. (1811).</p>

    <span class="smcap">Blow away, ye Morning Breezes</span>. Taken down, words and
    music, from Robert Hard. This curious song was to be sung by two
    sopranos; that is to say, one voice taunts the other, and the second
    replies, then both unite in the chorus. We have omitted the retort,
    which consists simply in the application of the same words to the
    first singer. It is certainly an early composition. One passage in
    it occurs in "The Knight and the Shepherd's Daughter," in Percy's
    "Relicks," and Child's "English and Scotch Ballads"—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Would I had drunk the water cleare<br>
            <span class="i2">When I had drunk the wine,</span><br>
            Rather than any shepherd's brat<br>
            <span class="i2">Should be a lady of mine.</span><br>
            Would I had drunk the puddle foule<br>
            <span class="i2">When I had drunk the ale," etc.</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The burden or chorus, "Blow away," etc., occurs also in the ballad of
    "The Baffled Knight."</p>

        class="smcap">The Hearty Good Fellow</span>. Taken down, words and music,
    from Robert Hard. This ballad is found on a Broadside by Pitts,
    entitled "Adventures of a Penny." The first verse there runs—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Long time I've travelled the North Country<br>
            Seeking for good company.<br>
            Good company I always could find,<br>
            But none was pleasing to my mind.<br>
            <span class="i5">Sing whack, fal de ral, etc.,</span><br>
            <span class="i7">I had one Penny."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The rest is very much the same as our version. I also heard it sung
    by a worker at the Aller Potteries, near Newton Abbot. Mr. Kidson has
    obtained a traditional version in Yorkshire, and Mr. C. Sharp one in
    Somersetshire from Eliza Hutchins of Langport. As the accent came
    wrong in the version we received from Hard, we have adopted that as
    given by Eliza Hutchins.</p>

        class="smcap">The Bonny Bunch of Roses</span>. Of this we have taken down a
    great number of versions. The melody is always the same. The youth in
    the printed Broadside copies is always Napoleon Bonaparte. History
    does not agree with what is said of the hero in the song. It is
    almost certainly an anti-Jacobite production, adapted to Napoleon,
    with an additional verse relative to Moscow. In the Broadside
    versions the song is given "To the tune of the Bunch of Roses, O!"
    indicating that there was an earlier ballad of the same nature.</p>

<p>This was a favourite fo'castle song in the middle of the nineteenth
    century. There is a version of it in Christie's "Traditional
    Ballads." One has also been recovered by Mr. Kidson in Yorkshire. The
    song was such a favourite that a public-house near Wakefield bears
    "The Bonny Bunch of Roses, O!" as its sign.</p>

    William Huggins, mason, of Lydford, who died in March 1889. He had
    been zealously engaged that winter going about among his ancient
    musical friends collecting old songs for me, when he caught a chill
    and died. The words he gave were those of the ballad, "The Little
    Girl down the Lane," and were of no merit. I have therefore discarded
    them and written fresh words, and dedicate them to the memory of poor
    old Will.</p>

<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_030"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_30_OLD_WICHET">30.</a>
    <span class="smcap">Old Wichet.</span> Taken from Thomas Darke of Whitstone. He
    had learned it in 1835 from a fellow labourer. Sung also by James
    Parsons, Samuel Fone, and J. Woodrich. It is said to be still popular
    in the North of England. A Scottish version in Herd's Collection,
    1769, and in Johnson's "Musical Museum," Edinburgh, 1787-1803, vol.
    v. p. 437. "Old Wichet" is in the Roxburgh Collection, and Bell has
    printed it in his "Ballads and Songs of the English Peasantry."</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold recast the song to a tune of his own in "Auld Robin Gray,"
    1794. The Scottish version begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"The good man cam hame at e'en<br>
            <span class="i2">And hame cam he.</span><br>
            And there he saw a saddle horse<br>
            <span class="i2">Where nae horse should be."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Arnold begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"'Twas on Christmas day, my father he did wed,<br>
            Three months after that, my mother was brought to bed."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>In the original English song the final line to each stanza runs—</p>

<p class="center">"Old Wichet went a cuckold out, and a cuckold he came home."</p>

<p>But in one version taken down—</p>

<p class="center">"When honest men went out, under a horned moon."</p>

<p>I have thought it advisable to modify the last line of each stanza,
    and to compose a last stanza, so as to give to the song a less
    objectionable character. A somewhat similar ballad exists in France,
    as "Marianne," in Lemoine, "<span lang="fr">Chansons du Limousin</span>," Limoges, 1890;
    in Daymard, "<span lang="fr">Vieux chants populaires de Quercy</span>," Cahors, 1889; "<span lang="fr">Le
Jaloux</span>," in <span lang="fr">Bladé, "Poésies populaires de Gascogne</span>," 1881. But, in
    fact, all these songs are the versification of an old troubadour
    tale, that is given in Barbazan, "<span lang="fr">Fabliaux et contes des poètes
François xi.-xiv. siècles</span>," as the "<span lang="fr">Chevalier à la robe vermeille</span>,"
    t. iii. p. 296. Alphonse Daudet, in "Numa Roumestan," introduces a
    great portion of the ballad. He says, "<span lang="fr">C'est sur un air grave comme
du plain-chant</span>." In the midst of the song, the person reciting it
    breaks off, and transported by enthusiasm exclaims: "<span lang="fr">Ça, voyez-vous,
mes enfants, c'est <i>bo</i> (beau) comme du Shakespeare</span>."</p>

        class="smcap">Jan's Courtship.</span> Words and air from Mr. R. Rowe,
    Longabrook, Milton Abbot. Another set, slightly different, from Mr.
    Crossing; another, practically identical, from Mr. Chowen, Brentor.
    As "Robin's Courtship," the song was recovered by Mr. E.T. Wedmore
    of Bristol, in Somersetshire. It has also been noted in the same
    county by Mr. Sharp as "William the Rose," sung to the tune of
    "Lillibulero." It is found in "The Universal Songster," <i>circ.</i> 1830,
    as "Poor Bob." In the "Roxburgh Ballads," vi. pp. 216-7, is what is
    probably the earliest form—"Come hither my dutiful son, and take
    counsel of me." This was sung to the air "Grim King of the Ghosts."
    Another version is referred to in the "Beggars' Opera," Act III. Sc.
    viii., "Now Roger I'll tell thee, because thou'rt my son."</p>

<p>Our tune is rugged, and Somersetshire in character. It is in the
    Æolian mode.</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_032"></a><a
        href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_32_THE_DROWNED_LOVER">32.</a> <span
        class="smcap">The Drowned Lover.</span> Taken down from James Parsons. This
    is a very early song. It first appears as "Captain Digby's Farewell,"
    in the "Roxburgh Ballads," iv. p. 393, printed in 1671. In Playford's
    "Choice Ayres," 1676, i. p. 10, it was set to music by Mr. Robert
    Smith. Then it came to be applied to the death of the Earl of
    Sandwich, after the action in Sole Bay, 1673. A black letter ballad,
    date <i>circ.</i> 1676, is headed, "To the tune of the Earl of Sandwich's
    Farewell." The original song consisted of three stanzas only; it
    became gradually enlarged and somewhat altered, and finally Sam
    Cowell composed a burlesque on it, which has served more or less to
    corrupt the current versions of the old song, printed on Broadsides
    by Catnach, Harkness, and others.</p>

<p>The black letter ballad of 1673 begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"One morning I walked by myself on the shoar<br>
            When the Tempest did cry and the Waves they did roar,<br>
            Yet the music of the Winds and the Waters was drownd<br>
            By the pitiful cry, and the sorrowful sound,<br>
            <span class="i2">Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah! my Love's dead.</span><br>
            <span class="i5">There is not a bell</span><br>
            <span class="i5">But a Triton's shell,</span><br>
            <span class="i2">To ring, to ring, to ring my Love's knell."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>"Colonel Digby's Lament," 1671, begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"I'll go to my Love, where he lies in the Deep,<br>
            And in my Embrace, my dearest shall sleep.<br>
            When we wake, the kind Dolphins together shall throng,<br>
            And in chariots of shells shall draw us along.<br>
            <span class="i2">Ah! Ah! My Love is dead.</span><br>
            <span class="i4">There was not a bell, but a Triton's shell,</span><br>
            <span class="i4">To ring, to ring out his knell."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>A second version of the melody, but slightly varied from that we
    give, was sent us by Mr. H. Whitfeld of Plymouth, as sung by his
    father. Our air is entirely different from that given by Playford,
    and is probably the older melody, which was not displaced by the
    composition of Mr. R. Smith. The song is sung to the same melody, but
    slightly varied, in Ireland.</p>

        class="smcap">Childe the Hunter.</span> Words taken in a fragmentary form
    from Jonas Coaker. He had used up the material of the ballad,
    incorporating it into a "poem" he had composed on Dartmoor, and
    vastly preferred his own doggerel to what was traditional. The
    Æolian melody given is that to which the Misses Phillips, who were
    born and reared at Shaw, on Dartmoor, informed me that they had
    heard the ballad sung about 1830. We also obtained this air to "Cold
    blows the wind." It is unquestionably an early harp tune, not later
    than the reign of Henry VII. For the story of Childe of Plymstock,
    see Murray's "Handbook of Devon," ed. 1887, p. 208; more fully and
    critically in W. Crossing's "Ancient Crosses of Dartmoor," 1887, p.
    51.</p>

    <span class="smcap">The Cottage Thatched with Straw.</span> Taken down, words and
    melody, from John Watts, quarryman, Alder, Thrushleton. This is one
    of the best known and, next to "Widdecombe Fair," most favourite
    songs of the Devon peasantry. Mr. Kidson has noted the song from a
    Worcestershire man. So far we have not been able to trace either
    words or melody, though neither can be earlier than the beginning
    of the nineteenth century, and the song has all the character of a
    published composition, and no spontaneous composition of a peasant.</p>

    Words and air sent me by J.S. Hurrell,
    Esq., Kingsbridge, who had learned them in the middle of last century
    from Mr. A. Holoran, a Devonshire schoolmaster. It has already been
    published as "Sylvia Sweet" in Dale's "Collection," <i>circ.</i> 1790. Two
    verses are given by Halliwell as traditional in his "Nursery Rhymes,"
    4th ed., 1846, p. 223.</p>

    <span class="smcap">A Sweet, Pretty Maiden.</span> Melody taken down from James
    Parsons. The words of his ballad were interesting and poetical, but
    did not fit the tune. It began—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"A maiden sweet went forth in May,<br>
            <span class="i1">Nor sheet nor clout she bare,</span><br>
            She went abroad all on the day<br>
            <span class="i1">To breathe the fresh spring air.</span><br>
            Before that she came back again<br>
            The maiden bore a pretty son,<br>
            <span class="i1">And she roll'd it all up in her apron."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The theme is the same as "She roun't in her apron" in Johnson's
    "Musical Museum," v. p. 437; and as it was quite impossible for us to
    print it, I have set to the air another song.</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_037"></a><a
        href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_37_THE_WHITE_COCKADE">37.</a> <span
        class="smcap">The White Cockade.</span> Words and tune from Edmund Fry.
    The words of this ballad are often mixed up with those of "It was
    one summer morning, as I went o'er the grass." The song used to be
    well known in Lancashire and Yorkshire. Several versions are given
    in Kidson's "Traditional Tunes." As we heard the song, the cockade
    was described as green, but there never was a green cockade. I have
    somewhat altered the words. The Jacobite song of the "White Cockade"
    is totally distinct. A Barnstaple ware punch-bowl with cover I have
    seen in the parish of Altarnon, Cornwall, has on the cover the figure
    of a piper with his dog, and the inscription, "Piper, play us the
    White Cockade." This can hardly refer to the Scottish song and tune.</p>

<p>In "Stray Garlands," B.M. (71621, a, b), is "The Blue Cockade," but
    this is a fusion of the two ballads.</p>

    Helmore. A Broadside version by Williams of Portsea, Wright of
    Birmingham, B.M. (1876, c 2). As Helmore and his wife sang the verses
    alternately, we have so arranged it.</p>

        class="smcap">A Maiden Sat a-Weeping.</span> Words and melody from James
    Parsons. Again, from Will Aggett, Chagford, identically the same. In
    our opinion a delicately beautiful song. The tune probably of the
    sixteenth century.</p>

        class="smcap">The Blue Kerchief.</span> Words and melody from John Woodrich,
    locally known as "Ginger Jack." The words have appeared, with slight
    variations, on Broadsides in ten verses. Catnach issued a parody on
    it, "The Bonny Blue Jacket." In Dr. Barrett's "English Folk-Songs,"
    he uses this tune for "Paul Jones."</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_041"></a><a

        class="smcap">Come to My Window.</span> This is a very early song, and
    the melody is found substantially the same from the time of Queen
    Elizabeth.</p>

<p>In Beaumont and Fletcher's "Knight of the Burning Pestle," printed in
    1613 and again in 1635, the merchant sings snatches of the song—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Go from my window, love, go;<br>
            Go from my window, my dear;<br>
            <span class="i3">The wind and the rain</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Will drive you back again,</span><br>
            <span class="i2">You can not be lodged here.</span><br>
            <br>
            "Begone, begone, my Juggy, my Puggy,<br>
            Begone, my love, my dear!<br>
            <span class="i3">The weather is warm,</span><br>
            <span class="i3">'Twill do thee no harm,</span><br>
            <span class="i2">Thou canst not be lodged here."—Act III.</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N12" id="Page_N12">-N12-</a></span></p>

<p>In Fletcher's "Monsieur Thomas," 1639, a maid sings—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Come to my window, love, come, come, come!<br>
            Come to my window, my dear:<br>
            <span class="i3">The wind and the rain</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Shall trouble thee again,</span><br>
            <span class="i2">But thou shalt be lodged here."—Act III. Sc. iii.</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>In Fletcher's "The Woman's Prize," 1640, Jaques says—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"A moral, sir; the ballad will express it:<br>
            <span class="i3">The wind and the rain</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Have turn'd you back again,</span><br>
            <span class="i2">And you cannot be lodged there."—Act I. Sc. iii.</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>It is evident that this ballad was very familiar in the latter part
    of the 16th century, and we find that on March 4, 1587-8, John Wolfe
    had a licence to print a ballad, entitled "Goe from my Window." It
    was one of those early songs parodied in "Ane compendious booke of
    Godly and Spirituall Songs," Edinburgh, 1590. This begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Quho (who) is at my windo, who, who?<br>
            <span class="i1">Goe from my windo; goe, goe.</span><br>
            Quha calls there, so like a strangere?<br>
            <span class="i1">Goe from my windo, goe!"</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>At the end of Heywood's "Rape of Lucrece," 1638, is—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Begone, begone, my Willie, my Billie,<br>
            <span class="i1">Begone, begone, my deere;</span><br>
            The weather is warm, 'twill doe thee no harm,<br>
            <span class="i1">Thou canst not be lodged here."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>And in this form it appears in "Wit and Drollery," 1661, p. 25.</p>

<p>In "Pills to Purge Melancholy," 1719, iv. 44, is another version of
    the song, beginning, "Arise arise, my juggy, my puggy." The tune
    is found in what is erroneously called Queen Elizabeth's "Virginal
    Book," and in "A New Book of Tablature," 1596; and in Morley's
    "First Book of Concert Lessons," 1599; and in Robinson's "Schoole of
    Musick," 1603. In the "Dancing Master," from 1650 to 1680, the tune
    is given under the title of "The New Exchange, or Durham Stable," but
    altered into 6-4 time to fit it for dancing.</p>

<p>The tune in its original form may be seen in Chappell, i. p. 141.</p>

<p>Chappell has also given a traditional form of the air as obtained at
    Norwich. Dr. Barrett has given another in his "English Folk-Songs,"
    No. 46, but without saying where he picked it up.</p>

<p>We obtained ours from John Woodrich; he heard it in an ale-house near
    Bideford in 1864, from an old man, who recited a tale, in which the
    song comes in in snatches. He had been soaked by the rain, and he
    told the tale as he dried himself by the kitchen fire. The story is
    this—</p>

<p>Two men courted a pretty maid; one was rich, the other poor; and the
    rich man was old, but she loved the young poor man. Her father, in
    spite of her tears, forced her to marry the rich man; but her other
    suitor came under her window and tapped, and when the husband was
    away she admitted him. So passed a twelvemonth, and she had a little
    child. Then, one night, the lover came under the window, thinking her
    goodman was from home. With his tapping the husband awoke, and asked
    what the sound was. She said that an ivy leaf, fluttered by the wind,
    struck the pane.</p>

<p>But fearing lest the lover should continue to tap, she began to sing,
    as she rocked the cradle—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Begone, begone, my Willie, my Billy,<br>
            <span class="i1">Begone my love and my dear.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">O the wind is in the west</span><br>
            <span class="i3">And the cuckoo's in his nest,</span><br>
            <span class="i2">And you cannot have a lodging here."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Again the lover tapped, and the husband asked what that meant. She
    said that a bat had flown against the window. Then she sang—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Begone, begone, my Willie, my Billy,<br>
            <span class="i1">Begone, my love and my dear.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">O the weather it is warm</span><br>
            <span class="i3">And it cannot do thee harm,</span><br>
            <span class="i2">And thou canst not have a lodging here."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Then the lover called, and the husband asked what that was. She said
    it was the hooting of an owl; and then she sang—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Begone, begone, my Willie, my Billy,<br>
            <span class="i1">Begone my love and my dear.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">O the wind and the rain</span><br>
            <span class="i3">Have brought him back again,</span><br>
            <span class="i2">But thou canst not have a lodging here."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N13" id="Page_N13">-N13-</a></span></p>

<p>Again the lover rapped; then she sprang out of bed, threw abroad the
    casement, and sang—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Begone, begone, my Willy, you silly,<br>
            <span class="i1">Begone, my Fool and my Dear.</span><br>
            <span class="i3">O the Devil's in the man,</span><br>
            <span class="i3">And he cannot understan',</span><br>
            <span class="i2">That to-night he cannot have a lodging here."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>This is almost certainly the original framework to which these
    snatches of song belong. But there was another version of the story
    in a ballad entitled "The Secret Lover, or the Jealous Father
    beguil'd, to a West Country tune, or Alack! for my love and I must
    dye," printed by P. Brooksby, between 1672 and 1682, given by Mr.
    Ebsworth in the "Roxburgh Ballads," vi. p. 205. This begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"A dainty spruce young Gallant, that lived in the West,<br>
            He courted a young Lady, and real love professt,<br>
            And coming one night to her, his mind he thus exprest—<br>
            <span class="i2">And sing, Go from my window, love, go!</span><br>
            <br>
            "'What, is my love a sleeping? or is my love awake?'<br>
            'Who knocketh at the window, who knocketh there so late?'<br>
            'It is your true love, Lady, that for your sake doth wait.'<br>
            <span class="i2">And sing, Go from my window, love, go!"</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Here the father, and not the husband, is the person who is
    troublesome to the lovers.</p>

<p>That this is an adaptation, and not the original form of the story,
    is obvious from the line—</p>

<p class="center">"And the cuckoo's in his nest,"</p>

<p>a play on the word cuckold.</p>

<p>A still later version, <i>circ.</i> 1770, is given by Ebsworth, "Roxburgh
    Ballads," vi. p. 205.</p>

<p>Messrs. Moffat and Kidson have given the song in the "Minstrelsy of
    England," <span class="sm">N.D.</span>, but 1903, p. 24. So also Dr. Barrett in his
    "English Folk-Songs," No. 26. I have recast the words. The song may
    derive from a tale used by Boccaccio in his "Decameron," vii. 1.</p>

    This song is alluded to in the "Complaynt
    of Scotland," 1549; it is probably the "Ballett of Tomalin," licensed
    to be printed in 1557-8. A snatch of it occurs in Wager's play: "The
    longer thou livest the more fool thou art," <i>circ.</i> 1560—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Tom a Lin and his wife and his wife's mother<br>

            The Devill go with you all, quoth Tom a Lin."</p>

<p>It was printed in Ritson's "North Country Chorister," Durham, 1802;
    and it occurs in "The Distracted Sailor's Garland," B.M. (11,621, c
    3). "Bryan o' Lynn was a gentleman born," as sung by "Mr. Purcell's
    celebrated Irish vocalists," is in the "Dublin Comic Songster,"
    Dublin, 1841. Halliwell gives the song in his "Popular Rhymes," 1849,
    p. 271, and one verse in his "Nursery Rhymes," No. 61.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Phillips, who founded the Aller Vale potteries, in a lecture
    on the condition of Dartmoor in 1837, says: "For roughing it on
    the moor, warm waterproof coats were made by using a sheep's skin,
    the wool on the inside. Warm caps of rabbit skin were common, with
    lappets over the ears. An old rhyme sung by the boys was—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Old Harry Trewin, no breeches to wear,<br>
            He stole a ram's skin to make a new pair.<br>
            The shiny side out and the woolly side in,<br>
            And thus doth go old Harry Trewin."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>We have taken down the song twice from Thomas Dart and from James
    Parsons. What "A Bone of my stover" signifies I am unable to say.</p>

    Robert Hard. Another sent me by Mr. Crossing, heard by him on
    Dartmoor from a labouring man in 1869. The same as this taken down
    from James Parsons. This latter sent by me to Miss Broadwood, who
    has published it in her "County Songs," p. 170. In Buckstone's play
    of "The Green Bushes," 1845, Nelly O'Neil sings snatches of this
    song, one verse, "I'll buy you fine petticoats," etc., in Act I.,
    and that and the following verse in Act III. Nowhere is the complete
    ballad given. That, however, owing to the popularity of the drama,
    was published soon after as a "popular Irish ballad sung by Mrs.
    FitzWilliam." Later it was attributed to the husband of that lady,
    Mr. E.F. FitzWilliam, but it was not published in his lifetime. The
    words are substantially old, in this form are a softening down of an
    earlier ballad which has its analogue in Scotland, "My daddie is a
    cankered carle," each verse of which ends—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"For he's low down, he's in the broom<br>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N14" id="Page_N14">-N14-</a></span></p>

<p>The English form is "Whitsun Monday," an early copy of which is in
    one of the collections in the British Museum, date about 1760. Each
    verse ends—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">

<p>Broadsides by Disley and Such. In a collection of early ballad books
    in the British Museum is "The Lady's Book of Pleasure," printed in
    Cow Lane, <i>circ.</i> 1760. This contains a ballad that begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"As I was a walking one morning in May,<br>
            I heard a young damsel to sigh and to say,<br>

            It was down in the meadow, among the Green Hay."</p>

<p>Another, with Green Bushes in place of Green Hay, published by Hodges

    "Ancient Music of Ireland," 1855. The Irish air is not the same as
    ours.</p>

    Christie's "Traditional Ballads," and Mr. Kidson obtained it in
    Yorkshire to a tune different from ours. The same as ours was noted
    down by Mr. S. Reay about 1830-5 from a ballad singer at Durham.</p>

    Brent, by H. Fleetwood Sheppard in 1888. The original words were
    very gross, and I did not note them. In the British Museum is an
    early Garland, and in the list of contents on the cover is "The Mole
    Catcher," but the song has been torn out, probably for the same
    reason that prevented me from taking it down. All I copied was the
    beginning of the song. I have supplemented this with fresh words.</p>

        class="smcap">The Keenly Lode.</span> Mr. Bussell and I spent a week in
    1894 at the Lugger Inn, Fowey, collecting songs. We met there one
    day an old miner, who asked us if we knew "The Keenly Lode," and on
    our saying that we did not, he gave us a long song on mining, that,
    however, lacked point. I have therefore re-composed the song. The air
    is that employed for "The Crocodile," an extravagant ballad, which
    has been published by Miss Broadwood in her "County Songs." Her tune
    is practically the same as ours, but there are some differences. "The
    Crocodile" is a very popular ballad among old song-men, but no one
    would care to sing it in a drawing-room or at a concert, because it
    is vastly silly.</p>

<p>"A Keenly Lode" is a lode that promises well. A "Bâll" is a mine in
    Cornish. In Cornwall every old man is termed "Uncle."</p>

<p>We have taken down "The Meat Pie" to the same air.</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_047"></a><a

        class="smcap">May Day Carol.</span> Melody and words noted down a good many
    years ago by J.S. Cayzer, Esq. It was sung, till of late years, in
    my neighbourhood, where a bunch of flowers at the end of a stick was
    carried about by children. It was customary in England for a lover
    on May morning to take a green bough to the house of the beloved. If
    she opened the door and took it in, this was a token of acceptance.
    At the Puritan epoch this custom was altered, and the song was
    converted into a carol with a moral to it, see "Notes and Queries,"
    Third Series, ix. p. 380; Hone's "Every Day Book," 1826, i. p. 567;
    Chambers' "Book of Days," i. p. 578. Herrick refers to the custom of
    youths bringing their May bushes to the maids of their choice:—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"A deale of youth ere this is come<br>
            Back, and with white thorn laden home,<br>
            Some have dispatched their cakes and cream,<br>
            Before that we have left to dream."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The melody is a very early one in the Dorian mode, and resembles that
    of the carol, "The Moon shines bright," Broadwood's "County Songs,"
    p. 108. The carol is still sung in Cornwall.</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_048"></a><a

        class="smcap">The Lovers' Tasks.</span> This very curious song belongs,
    as I was told, in Cornwall, to a sort of play that was wont to be
    performed in farmhouses at Christmas. One performer, a male, left
    the room, and entered again singing the first part. A girl, seated
    on a chair, responded with the second part. The story was this. She
    had been engaged to a young man who died. His ghost returned to
    claim her. She demurred to this, and he said that he would waive his
    claim if she could perform a series of tasks he set her. To this
    she responded that he must, in the first place, accomplish a set of
    impossible tasks she would set him. Thus was he baffled.</p>

<p>"In all stories of this kind," says Professor Child, "the person
    upon whom a task is imposed stands acquitted if another of no less
    difficulty is devised which must be performed first."</p>

<p>This ballad and dramatic scene corresponds with that in "Cold blows
    the wind" (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_6_COLD_BLOWS_THE_WIND_SWEET-HEART">No.
        6</a>). There, in the original, the ghost desires to draw
    the girl underground, when she is seated on his grave. She objects,
    and he sets her a task—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Go fetch me a light from dungeon deep,<br>
            <span class="i1">Wring water from a stone,</span><br>
            And likewise milk from a maiden's breast,<br>
            <span class="i1">That never babe had none."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N15" id="Page_N15">-N15-</a></span></p>

<p>She answers the requirement—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"She stroke a light from out a flint,<br>
            <span class="i1">An icebell squeezed she,</span><br>
            And likewise milk from a Johnnis' wort,<br>
            <span class="i1">And so she did all three."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Icebell is icicle. By this means she was quit. In the version I have
    given I have altered this to suit the song for modern singing.</p>

<p>In "The Elfin Knight," Child's "British Ballads," No. 2, an elf
    appears to the damsel and sets her tasks. If she cannot accomplish
    these, she must accompany him to the elf world. Here we have a
    substitution of a fairy for a ghost.</p>

<p>In an Ulster Broadside in the British Museum (1162, k 5) we have
    a later substitution. A low-born gamekeeper gets a damsel of high
    degree into his power, and will not release her unless she can solve
    a series of riddles. This she does, and so makes her escape.</p>

<p>Of the Northumbrian ballad, "Lay the Bent to the Bonny Broom," Child,
    No. 1, there are two versions. In one given by Miss Mason, "Nursery
    Rhymes and Country Songs," a stranger comes to the door of a house
    where are three sisters, and demands that one shall follow him or
    answer a series of riddles. Then ensues a contest of wit, and the
    girl escapes the obligation of following the mysterious stranger.
    Who he is is not ascertained. In the other version it is different;
    he is a knight, and he offers to marry the girl who can solve his
    riddles. The youngest sister effects this, so he marries her. It is
    the same in the corresponding Cornish ballad of "Genefer Gentle and
    Rosemarie," originally given by Gilbert in his "Cornish Christmas
    Carols," 2nd ed., p. 65, and reprinted by Child.</p>

<p>To the same category belongs the song, "Go no more a-rushing, Maids,
    in May," that we have taken down from several singers, and which is
    given as well by Miss Mason, and by Chappell, i. p. 158, where the
    task is to solve riddles—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"I'll give you a chicken that has no bone,<br>
            I'll give you a cherry without a stone,<br>
            I'll give you a ring that has no rim,<br>
            I'll give you an oak that has no limb."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The solution is—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"When the chicken is in the egg it has no bone,<br>
            When the cherry is in bloom it has no stone,<br>
            When the ring is a-melting it has no rim,<br>
            When the oak is in the acorn it has no limb."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>But the story about the setting of the puzzle has fallen away.</p>

<p>We did obtain a ballad in Cornwall about the ghost visiting the
    damsel and demanding that she should keep her engagement, but the
    metre was not the same as that of the "Lovers' Tasks."</p>

<p>Apparently at some remote period a maiden who was pledged to a man
    was held to belong to him after he was dead, and to be obliged to
    follow her lover into the world of spirits, unless she could evade
    the obligation by some clever contrivance. When this idea fell away,
    either an elf was substituted or a man of low birth, or else the
    whole story was dropped; or, again, it was so altered that a knight
    was put in the place of the ghost, and it became the privilege of the
    shrewd girl who could answer the riddles to be taken as his wife.</p>

<p>The setting of hard tasks occurs in German folk-tales, as in
    "Rumpelstiltskin," where the girl has to spin straw into gold.</p>

<p>In the "Gesta Romanorum," ed. Osterley, p. 374, one of the most
    popular collections of stories in the Middle Ages, is a corrupt
    reminiscence of the tale. A king delayed to take a wife till he could
    find one sagacious enough to make him a shirt without seam out of a
    scrap of linen three inches square. She retorts that she will do this
    when he sends her a vessel in which she can do the work. Jacques de
    Voragine wrote his "Golden Legend" in or about 1260. In that he tells
    this tale. A bishop was about to succumb to the blandishments of the
    devil in female form, when a pilgrim arrived. Either the damsel or
    the palmer must leave, and which it should be was to be determined by
    the solution of riddles. The pilgrim solved two. Then the fiend in
    female form asked: "How far is it from heaven to earth?" "That you
    know best, for you fell the whole distance," replied the palmer, and
    the fiend vanished. Then the pilgrim revealed himself as St. Andrew,
    to whom the bishop had a special devotion.</p>

<p>The classic tale of Œdipus and the Sphinx will be remembered in
    connection with delivery from death by solving riddles. In Norse
    mythology we have the contest in conundrums between Odin and the
    giant Vafthrudnir. The Rabbis tell of the Queen of Sheba proving
    Solomon with hard questions, which are riddles.</p>

<p>The historians of Tyre, as Josephus informs us, recorded that an
    interchange of riddles went on constantly between Solomon and Hiram,
    each being under an engagement to pay a forfeit of money for every
    riddle that he could not solve. Solomon got the best of Hiram, till
    Hiram set a Tyrian boy to work, who both solved the riddles of
    Solomon, and set others which Solomon could not answer. We have a
    later version of this story in the ballad of King John and the Abbot
    of Canterbury, who, unable to solve the king's riddles, set his
    cowherd to do this, and he accomplished it successfully.</p>

<p>We took down the ballad and air from Philip Symonds of Jacobstow,
    Cornwall, also from John Hext, Two Bridges, and from James Dyer of
    Mawgan. The burden, "And every grove rings with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N16"
                                                                              id="Page_N16">-N16-</a></span> merry
    antine," is
    curious; <i>antine</i> is antienne—anthem. In "Gammer Gurton's Garland,"
    1783, the burden is "Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme." In one of
    Motherwell's MSS. it stands, "Every rose grows merry wi' thyme."
    These are attempts made to give sense where the meaning of the
    original word was lost.</p>

<p>In <i>Folk-Song Journal</i>, vol. i. p. 83, is a version from Sussex:
    "Sing Ivy, Sing Ivy."</p>

    John Woodrich. Versions also
    from Peter Cheriton, shoemaker, Oakford, near Tiverton; William
    Setter and George Kerswell, Two Bridges, Dartmoor. Robert Browning
    composed on this theme his poem, "The Flight of the Duchess," having
    heard a beggar woman sing the ballad. Mrs. Gibbons told me she heard
    the whole ballad sung by her nurse in Cornwall, about 1830.</p>

<p>The Scottish version of the ballad is that of "Johnny Faa," in Allan
    Ramsay's "Tea-Table Miscellany," 1724, from which it passed into
    all collections of Scottish songs. Allan Ramsay's version turns on
    a story—utterly unhistorical—that Lady Jean Hamilton, married to
    the grim Covenanter, John, Earl of Cassilis, fell in love with, and
    eloped with, Sir John Faa of Dunbar, who came to the castle disguised
    as a gipsy along with some others. She was pursued, and Faa and his
    companions were hung. No such an event took place. The Scotch are
    wont to take an old ballad, give it local habitation and name, and so
    make it out to be purely Scottish. My impression is that this was an
    old English ballad dealt with by Ramsay. It may have been so adapted
    for political purposes, as a libel on Lady Cassilis, who was the
    mother of Bishop Burnet's wife. An Irish form of the ballad in the
    British Museum (1162, k 6). For a full account of the "Johnny Faa"
    ballad, see Child's "English and Scottish Ballads," No. 200. He is of
    opinion that the English ballad is taken from the Scottish. I think
    the reverse is the case. Parsons sang right through without division
    of parts. I have made the division, so as to allow of the use of both
    airs; but actually the second is a modern corruption of the first,
    and is interesting as showing how completely a melody may undergo
    transformation. Mr. Sharp has given a Somersetshire version of the
    ballad in his "Folk Songs from Somerset," No. 9.</p>

        class="smcap">The Wreck off Scilly.</span> Words and melody from James
    Parsons. The ballad as sung consisted of seven verses. Broadside by
    Catnach. The last verse in this is nonsense, and I have re-written
    this verse. Under the title "The Rocks of Scilly," it occurs, in
    twenty-two verses, in "The Sailor's Tragedy," Glasgow, 1802.</p>

    Words and melody from Roger Luxton,
    Halwell. Again, from Matthew Baker, James Parsons, and from a
    shepherd on Dartmoor. The versions slightly differed, as far as words
    went. In one, Henry Martyn receives his death-wound; in another, it
    is the king's ship that is sunk by the pirate.</p>

<p>Mr. Kidson has printed two versions of the song in his "Traditional
    Tunes," from Yorkshire sources. Miss Broadwood has also collected it,
    <i>Folk-Song Journal</i>, vol. i. p. 162, in Sussex.</p>

<p>Henry Martyn is a corruption of Andrew Barton. In 1476, a Portuguese
    squadron seized a richly laden ship, commanded by John Barton, in
    consequence of which letters of reprisal were granted by James IV.
    to the three sons, Andrew, Robert, and John, and these were renewed
    in 1506. Hall, in his "Chronicle," under 1511, says that King Henry
    VIII. being at Leicester, tidings reached him that Andrew Barton so
    stopped the king's ports that the merchant vessels could not pass
    out, and he seized their goods, pretending that they were Portuguese.
    Sir Edward Howard, Lord High Admiral, and Sir Thomas Howard were sent
    against him. Their two ships were separated, but a fight ensued, in
    which Andrew was wounded, and his vessel, the <i>Lion</i>, was taken. He
    died of his wounds.</p>

<p>The ballad was re-composed in the reign of James I., and this is
    published in Percy's "Relicks" and in Evans' "Old Ballads." For an
    account of Sir Andrew Barton, see Child's "English and Scottish
    Ballads," No. 167. The ballad in full in Percy's MS. book is in
    sixty-four stanzas. Our form of the ballad is probably earlier, but
    it is incomplete. I have added the last verse to give a finish to the
    story. The tune is in the Æolian mode.</p>

    In the early part of last century this song
    was sung at all harvest suppers in the West of England. It is known
    elsewhere, but not to the same tune. A version of "The Fox" in the
    tenth volume of "Notes and Queries," 1854, is spoken of as "an old
    Cornish Song." In "Gammer Gurton's Garland," <i>circ.</i> 1783, is one
    verse of the song. It occurs in "The Opera, or Cabinet of Song,"
    Edinburgh, 1832. Halliwell, in his "Nursery Rhymes," Percy Soc.,
    1842, gives a fuller version than ours. He begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"The fox and his wife they had a great strife,<br>
            They never eat mustard in all their life;<br>
            They eat their meat without fork or knife,<br>
            <span class="i2">And loved to be picking a bone, e-no!"</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N17" id="Page_N17">-N17-</a></span></p>

<p>In a collection of songs in the British Museum is the ballad on a
    Broadside by Harkness of Birmingham. It begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"The fox went out of a moon-shiny night,<br>
            When the moon and the stars they shined so bright;<br>
            I hope, said the Fox, we'll have a good night,<br>
            <span class="i4">When we go to yonder town, O!</span><br>
            <span class="i6">Mogga, mogga, Reynard.</span><br>

            <span class="i2">And I wish I was through the town, O!"</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The tune we give was taken down from James Parsons. There were two
    other airs to which it was sung in other parts of England. These I
    give—</p>

        class="smcap">The Oxen Ploughing.</span> This song was known throughout Devon
    and Cornwall at the beginning of the 19th century. It went out of
    use along with the oxen at the plough. We found every old singer had
    heard it in his boyhood, but none could recall more than snatches
    of the tune and some of the words. We were for three years on its
    traces, always disappointed. Then we heard that there was an old
    man at Liskeard who could sing the song through. Mr. Sheppard and
    I hastened thither, to find that he had been speechless for three
    days, and that his death was hourly expected. One day I found an
    old white-headed and white-bearded man cutting ferns in the hedges
    at Trebartha in Cornwall. His name was Adam Landry. We got into
    conversation. I had heard he was a singer, and I asked after this
    especial song. He knew it. I sat down among the cut fern and learned
    it from him, singing it over and over till I had it by heart, and
    then drove home eighteen miles, warbling it the whole way, and went
    to my piano and fixed it. Later we found a labouring man, Joseph
    Dyer, at Mawgan-in-Pyder, who could sing the song through.</p>

<p>Mr. Sharp has also taken this down note for note in North Devon from
    an old farmer, Mr. Lake of Worlington, who remembered the use of oxen
    ploughing.</p>

<p>A very similar folk-song is found in France, with its refrain, naming
    the oxen—</p>

<div class="center">

        class="smcap">Flora, The Lily of The West.</span> Two melodies have been
    noted down to this ballad, one from Matthew Baker, the old cripple on
    Lew Down, the other from Samuel Fone. The first is identical with one
    obtained in Yorkshire by Mr. Kidson.</p>

<p>The words are on Broadsheets by Such, Fortey, Barr of Leeds, etc.</p>

<p>In the original the lover betrayed by Flora stabs to the heart the
    "lord of high degree" who has supplanted him—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"I walked up to my rival with a dagger in my hand,<br>
            And seized him from my false love, and bid him boldly stand;<br>
            Then, mad with desperation, I swore I'd pierce his breast,<br>
            And I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N18" id="Page_N18">-N18-</a></span></p>

<p>He is tried for murder, but "a flaw was in the indictment found," and
    he escapes the gallows. And the ballad winds up—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Although she swore my life away, she still disturbs my rest,<br>
            I must ramble for my Flora, the Lily of the West."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>I have thought it well to cut out the murder and the trial.</p>

<p>The ballad has clearly an Irish origin, what air is used for it in
    Ireland I am unable to say. It has been generally accepted that the
    ending of a phrase on the same three notes is characteristic of Irish
    music. It is not more so than of English folk airs. "Flora, the
    Lily of the West" was wont to be sung annually at the Revel at St.
    Breward's on the Bodmin Moors, and can be traced back there to 1839.
    There Henry Hawken, sexton at Michaelstow, hard by, acquired it, and
    from him the first melody was taken down as well by the Rev. W.J.
    Wyon, vicar of St. Issey, in 1899.</p>

        class="smcap">The Simple Ploughboy.</span> This charming ballad was taken
    down, words and music, from J. Masters, Bradstone. The Broadside
    versions that were published by Fortey, Hodges, Taylor of
    Spitalfields, Ringham of Lincoln, and Pratt of Birmingham, are all
    very corrupt. The version of old Masters is given exactly as he sang
    it, and it is but one instance out of many of the superiority of the
    ballads handed down traditionally in the country by unlettered men,
    to those picked up from the ballad-mongers employed by the Broadside
    publishers.</p>

<p>A version of the song, "It's of a Pretty Ploughboy," is given in the
    <i>Folk-Song Journal</i>, vol. i. p. 132, as taken down in Sussex. The
    words are very corrupt, and they closely resemble those on Broadsides.</p>

        class="smcap">Fair Lady Pity Me.</span> Taken down from a labouring man at
    Exbourne. The melody is ancient and dates from the Tudor period.
    The words are a fragment from "The Noble Lord's Cruelty," "Roxburgh
    Ballads," ed. Ebsworth, vi. 681-3. Its date is before 1624. But
    that was to be sung to the tune, "Dainty come Thou to Me," which is
    in Chappell, ii. p. 517. A ballad, "The Four Wonders of the Land,"
    printed by P. Brocksby, 1672-95, was set to the tune, "Dear Love
    Regard My Grief," which are the initial words of this song, and shows
    that already the long ballad had been broken up.</p>

<p>This song has already been given, arranged by Dr. Bussell, who took
    it down, in "English Minstrelsie," iv. p. 84.</p>

        class="smcap">The Painful Plough.</span> Words and melody from Roger Huggins,
    mason, Lydford. It is in reality a much longer song. Under the title
    of "The Ploughman's Glory" it runs to 25 verses. Bell gives 9 in his
    "Ballads of the English Peasantry." It is found on Broadsides. In
    the original it consists of a contention between a ploughman and a
    gardener as to which exercises the noblest profession. Our air is
    not the same as that to which the song is sung in the Midlands and
    south-east of England. Dr. Barrett gives the song in his "English
    Folk-Songs," No. 3, to a North Country air.</p>

        class="smcap">At the Setting of the Sun.</span> This very curious ballad has
    been taken down twice, from Samuel Fone by Mr. Sheppard, and again by
    Mr. Cecil Sharp from the singing of Louie Hooper and Lucy White at
    Hambridge, Somerset, to a different air. Fone had forgotten portions
    of the song. The man who mistakes his true love for a swan because
    she had thrown her apron over her head as a protection from the rain
    is tried at the assizes for the murder—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"In six weeks' time when the 'sizes came on,<br>
            Young Polly appeared in the form of a swan,<br>
            Crying Jimmy, young Jimmy, young Jimmy is clear,<br>
            He never shall be hung for the shooting of his dear."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>And he is, of course, acquitted.</p>

<p>In Fone's version she appears in dream to her lover as a swan, and
    comforts him, but the sequel of the story he could not recall.</p>

<p>The ballad is found in a fragmentary condition in Kent—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"O cursed be my uncle for lendin' of a gun.<br>
            For I've bin' and shot my true love in the room of a swan."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>And the apparition of the girl says—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"With my apron tied over me, I 'peared like unto a swan,<br>
            And underneath the green tree while the showers did come on."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>This was heard in 1884, sung by a very old man at a harvest supper at
    Haverstall Doddington, near Faversham.</p>

<p>The transformation of the damsel into a swan stalking into the Court
    is an early feature, and possibly the ballad may be a degraded form
    of a very ancient piece.</p>

<p>This ballad, arranged as a song with accompaniment by Mr. Ferris
    Tozer, has been published by Messrs. Weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. Sharp has given the song to a different air in his "Folk-Songs
    from Somerset," No. 16.</p>

    <span class="smcap">All Jolly Fellows that follow the Plough.</span> This song is
    very generally known. We have picked up four variants of the tune.
    Miss Broadwood gives one from Oxfordshire and one from Hampshire, but
    hers lack the chorus. Mr. C. Sharp has also gathered three. He says:
    "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N19" id="Page_N19">-N19-</a></span> find that almost every singer knows it,
    the bad singers often
    know but little else. Perhaps it is for this reason that the tune is
    very corrupt, the words are almost always the same."</p>

<p>In the second verse we have the breakfast described as consisting
    of bread and cheese and stingo. In Miss Broadwood's version the
    breakfast consists of cold beef and pork; the drink is not specified.</p>

        class="smcap">The Golden Vanity.</span> Taken down, words and air, from James
    Oliver. The ballad was printed as "Sir Walter Raleigh sailing in the
    Lowlands, showing how the famous ship called the <i>Sweet Trinity</i>
    was taken by a false galley; and how it was recovered by the craft
    of a little sea-boy, who sunk the galley," by Coles, Wright, Vere,
    and Conyers (1648-80). In this it is said that the ballad is to be
    sung "to the tune of The Lowlands of Holland," and in it there is
    ingratitude shown to the poor sea-boy of a severe character. In this
    version there are fourteen verses. It begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Sir Walter Raleigh has built a ship,<br>
            <span class="i3">In the Netherlands.</span><br>
            And it is called the <i>Sweet Trinity</i>,<br>
            And was taken by the false Gallaly,<br>
            <span class="i3">Sailing in the Lowlands."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>It has been reprinted in Child, No. 286, as also the earliest form of
    the ballad from the Pepys Collection. By writing some of the words
    as "awa'" and "couldna'," it has been turned into a Scottish ballad.
    Under the form of "The Goulden Vanity," it is given with an air (of
    no value) in Mrs. Gordon's "Memoirs of Christopher North," 1862, ii.
    p. 317, as sung at a convivial meeting at Lord Robertson's, by Mr. P.
    Fraser of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>We obtained the same ballad at Chagford as "The Yellow Golden Tree."
    "Sir Walter Raleigh," says Mr. Ebsworth, in his introduction to the
    ballad in the "Roxburgh Ballads" (v. p. 418), "never secured the
    popularity, the natural affection which were frankly given to Robert
    Devereux, the Earl of Essex. Raleigh was deemed arrogant, selfish,
    with the airs of an upstart, insolent to superiors, unconciliating
    with equals, and heartlessly indifferent to those in a lower
    position. The subject of the ballad is fictitious—sheer invention,
    of course. The selfishness and ingratitude displayed by Raleigh
    agreed with the current estimate. He certainly had a daughter."</p>

<p>In the ballad in the Pepys Collection the <i>Sweet Trinity</i>, a ship
    built by Sir Walter Raleigh, has been taken by a galley of a
    nationality not specified. He asks whether any seaman will take the
    galley and redeem his ship: the reward shall be a golden fee and his
    daughter. A ship-boy volunteers and with his auger bores fifteen
    holes in the galley and sinks her, and releases the <i>Sweet Trinity</i>.
    Then he swims back to his ship and demands his pay. The master will
    give golden fee but not his daughter. The ship-boy says, Farewell,
    since you are not so good as your word.</p>

<p>In the stall copy of the ballad, the master refuses to take the boy
    on board after he had sunk the galley, and threatens to shoot him,
    and the boy is drowned. Then he is picked up, is sewed in a cow-hide
    and thrown overboard.</p>

<p>Mr. Kidson has obtained no less than four different versions from
    sailors.</p>

<p>A version from Sussex is in <i>Folk-Song Journal</i>, vol. i. p. 104.
    Another in Miss Broadwood's "English County Songs." It is also in
    Ferris Tozer's "Sailors' Songs and Chanties." The black letter ballad
    of "Sir Walter Raleigh Sailing in the Lowlands low ... or the <i>Sweet
        Trinity</i>" was priced in Russell Smith's catalogue, £1, 5s.</p>

    have written fresh
    words.</p>

<p>In connection with this charming air, I will give Mr. Cayzer's
    account of taking it down in 1849, which he has kindly extracted for
    me from his diary:—"This air, together with 'As Johnny walked out'
    (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_11_AS_JOHNNY_WALKED_OUT">No. 11</a>), I got
    from Dartmoor; nor shall I soon forget the occasion.
    The scene was a lonely one (I think Two Bridges, but it may have been
    Post Bridge). It had been raining all day. There was not a book in
    the house, nor musical instrument of any kind, except two hungry pigs
    and a baby that was being weaned. Towards nightfall there dropped in
    several miners and shepherds, and I well remember how the appearance
    of these Gentiles cheered us. We soon got up a glorious fire—such a
    fire as peat only can make, and drew the benches and settles round.
    By the friendly aid of sundry quarts of cyder I, before long, gained
    the confidence of the whole circle, and got a song from each in
    turn; and noted down two that were quite new to me: no easy matter,
    considering that they were performed in a strange mixture of double
    bass and falsetto. The action with which they accompanied the singing
    was extremely appropriate. They always sing standing."</p>

<p>Many a similar evening have Mr. Sheppard, Mr. Bussell, and I spent in
    like manner over the peat fire with the burly, red-faced moor men and
    shepherds, standing to sing their quaint old songs, and very happy
    evenings they have been.</p>

<p>The same melody was taken down by Miss Wyatt Edgell from an old woman
    near Exeter, in 1891. The words sung to it related to the same Oxford
    Tragedy, but were a version different from the stall copy.</p>

    from an old moor man, to "Rosemary Lane." Roger Luxton and James
    Parsons also sang "Rosemary Lane" to the same air. The words are
    objectionable. Moreover, in other parts of England, this Broadside
    song is always sung to one particular air. We therefore thought it
    well to put to our melody entirely fresh words.</p>

<p>It was a common belief in the West of England that a soul after death
    appeared as a blue flame; and that a flame came from the churchyard
    to the house of one doomed to die, and hovered on the doorstep till
    the death-doomed expired, when the soul of the deceased was seen
    returning with the other flame, also as a flame, to the churchyard.</p>

        class="smcap">Strawberry Fair.</span> Melody taken down from James Masters.
    This is a very old song. It is found with music in "Songs and
    Madrigals of the 15th Century," published by the Old English
    Plain-Song Society, 1891. The ballad was recast "Kytt has lost her
    Key," which is given by Dr. Rimbault in his "Little Book of Songs and
    Ballads gathered from Ancient Music Books," 1851, p. 49. We have been
    forced to re-write the words, which were very indelicate. The air
    was used, in or about 1835, by Beuler, a comic song writer, for "The
    Devil and the Hackney Coachman"—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Ben was a Hackney coachman sure,<br>
            Jarvey! Jarvey!—Here I am, your honour."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>I have never found a singer who had any knowledge of Beuler's song,
    but all have heard "Strawberry Fair," and some men of seventy or
    eighty years of age say they learned it from their fathers.</p>

        class="smcap">The Song of the Moor.</span> The melody was taken down at
    Merrivale Bridge, Dartmoor, from a quarryman named Nankivel, commonly
    known as "Old Capul." To this air he sang a farcical ballad, "The
    Infant," quite unworthy of it. I have, accordingly, written fresh
    words to a really good swinging tune.</p>

<p>The original began as follows—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"O when I was an Infant, to London I did go,<br>
            Among the French and Spaniards my gallantry to show.<br>
            And when I reached the Eastern shore, I let my head hang down,<br>
            I tripped over Baganells (?) and never touched the ground.<br>
            <span class="i9">Fal-de-ral-de, etc.</span><br>
            <br>
            "So when I reached the Eastern shore, I met a giant high,<br>
            He lookèd down upon me, and bade me pass him by.<br>
            He challenged me to dance and sing, to whistle and to run,<br>
            I beat him out of all his wits, and kill'd him when I'd done.<br>
            <br>
            "The people in amazement stood, to see what I had done,<br>
            They gave me silver plate, about a fifty ton.<br>
            I made myself a little box, about three acres square,<br>
            I filled it to the very top, with my bright silver ware."</p>
    </div>

<p>And so on through a string of absurdities. It is apparently a
    modernised version of "The Jovial Broomman," by R. Climsall,
    published by R. Harper, 1635-1642. "Roxburgh ballads," ed. Chappell,

    </div>
</div>

<p>For good reasons we could not give the words as taken down, so Mr.
    Sheppard wrote fresh words to the tune. The ballad was obtained from
    Roger Huggins, Lydford, and from William Bickle, Bridestowe, but
    it is known and sung throughout Devon and Cornwall. The original
    ballad was altered by Burns to "The Waukrife Mammy" for Johnson's
    "Museum," iv. p. 210, and Allan Cuningham also arranged a song on the
    same theme, as the original was objectionable. Lyle gives it in his
    "Ballads," 1827, saying: "This ballad, in its original dress, at one
    time, from my recollection, was not only extremely popular, but a
    great favourite among the young peasantry of the West of Scotland. To
    suit the times, however, we have been necessitated to throw out the
    intermediate stanzas, as their freedom would not bear transcription,
    whilst the second and third have been slightly altered from the
    recited copy." An Irish version (re-written) to the Irish air, by
    Joyce, "Ancient Irish Music," 1873, No. 17. He says: "I cannot tell
    when I learned the air and words of this song, for I have known
    them as long as my memory can reach back. For several reasons [the
    original words] could not be presented to the reader."</p>

<p>Burns, when forwarding the ditty to Johnson, said of it: "I picked
    up this old song and tune from a country girl in Nithsdale; I
    never met with it elsewhere in Scotland." The words may be found
    on Broadsheets, printed by Such and by Bebbington, Manchester. Mr.
    Kidson has recovered several versions in Yorkshire, and one is given
    in the <i>Folk-Song Journal</i>, vol. i. p. 92, as taken down in Sussex,
    and two were in vol. ii. p. 9 noted down by Mr. Sharp in Somerset.
    Our tune is in the Dorian mode.</p>

        class="smcap">The Spotted Cow.</span> Words and air from James Parsons, J.
    Helmore, H. Smith, and J. Woodrich. Mr. Sharp has also taken it down
    in N. Devon and in Somerset.</p>

<p>The earliest form of the words is found in a garland printed by Angus
    of Newcastle, B.M. (11,621, c 4). There are later Broadside versions.
    The words also in Fairburne's "Everlasting Songster," <i>circ.</i> 1825.
    Mr. Kidson gives the song in his "Traditional Tunes," p. 70, but to a
    melody different from ours. About 1760 Dr. Berg set the song, recast
    in a Scotch form: "As Jamie gang'd blithe his way along the banks of
    Tweed," to be sung at Ranelagh. As sung, the ballad consists of four
    lines in a stanza, and the two last are repeated; and it is in seven
    stanzas. To shorten the ballad I have made each stanza consist of six
    lines. Our tune is not that of Dr. Berg. But it is redolent of the
    art-music of the 18th or early 19th century, and hardly possesses the
    character of folk-made song. Still, it is very freely sung by old
    people in Devon and Somerset.</p>

        class="smcap">Three Jovial Welshmen.</span> Taken down from "Old Capul,"
    Nankivel, Merrivale Bridge. The song is given in Halliwell's "Nursery
    Rhymes of England," 290. It is probably a very old ballad, for in a
    ballad, "Choice of Inventions," printed by F. Coles, 1646-74, in the
    Roxburgh Collection (ed. Chappell, i. p. 105), is given a pot-pourri
    of scraps, "several sorts of the figure three," and it begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"There were three men of Gotham, as I've heard say,<br>
            That needs would ride a hunting upon St. David's Day.<br>
            Through all the day they hunting were, yet no sport could they see,<br>
            Untill they spide an Owle as she sate on a tree.<br>
            The first man said 'twas a Goose, the second man said Nay,<br>
            The third man said 'twas a Hawke, but his Bells were falne away."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The tune to which it was to be sung was "Rock the Cradle, sweet
    John," for which, see Chappell, i. p. 189.</p>

<p>Another, and more modern version, is that of "The Three Jovial
    Huntsmen"—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"It's of three jovial huntsmen an' a hunting they did go;<br>
            An' they hunted, an' they hallo'd, an' they blew their horns also,"</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>which has been illustrated by Caldecott.</p>

<p>The original ballad is in "The Woody Chorister," B.M. (1162, e 2).</p>

<p>This is one of the ballads Mr. Incledon Johns heard sung on the
    outskirts of Dartmoor in 1830, mentioned in his book, already
    noticed, published in 1832.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N22" id="Page_N22">-N22-</a></span></p>

<p>A version, "Six Jovial Welshmen," is given in vol. i. p. 128,
    <i>Folk-Song Journal</i>, from Sussex. It runs—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"It's of six jovial Welshmen, six jovial men were they,<br>
            And they would all a hunting ride, upon St. David's Day.<br>
            Then fill each glass and let it pass, no sign of care betray,<br>
            We'll drink and sing, 'Long live the King!' upon St. David's Day."<br>
            <br>
            "When crook-back'd Richard wore the crown, as regent of the land,<br>
            No policy could pull him down, nor his proud foe withstand.<br>
            A tribute he from them did seek, which they refused to pay,<br>
            And in their caps they wore a leek, upon St. David's Day.<br>
            Then fill each glass, and let it pass, etc."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>This is probably a re-edition of the older song.</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_076"></a><a
        href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_76_WELL_MET_WELL_MET">76.</a> <span
        class="smcap">Well met, well met, my own true Love.</span> The words are a
    cento from the lengthy ballad of the "Carpenter's Wife," which, as
    we have taken it down, consists of twenty verses. The black letter
    Broadside, "The Carpenter's Wife," is a peculiarly interesting
    ballad. It is the story of one Jane Reynolds of Plymouth, who had
    plighted her troth to a seaman. As they were about to be married,
    he was pressed and carried off to sea. Three years later, news
    arrived that he was dead, and then she married a carpenter, and
    lived with him for five years, and bore him three children. At the
    end of seven years an evil spirit assumed the likeness of her dead
    lover, and appeared to her, and induced her to leave with him. He
    carried her off, and she was never seen again. The husband, in
    despair, hung himself. Such is the theme of a lengthy ballad in the
    Roxburgh Collection, ed. Chappell, iii. p. 200. There are copies as
    well in the Pepys and Ewing Collections. It was printed by F. Coles
    (1646-1674), Gilbertson (1654-1663), Vere (1640-1680), and W. Oney
    (1650-1702). It was a sorry composition.</p>

<p>Now, the traditional ballad, as compared with the printed ballad, is
    superior at every point. It begins abruptly with the address of the
    sailor to the carpenter's wife, without the long story that precedes
    his attempt to cajole her to elope. Moreover, there is in it no
    intimation that the tempter is an evil spirit in the form of the dead
    lover, and when she has eloped, she pines not for three, but for her
    one babe, whom she has deserted.</p>

<p>Thirteen of the verses of the traditional ballad are found in "The
    Rambler's Garland," B.M. (1162, c 2). A form closely resembling our
    Devon ballad is in Buchan's "Ballads of the North of Scotland," i.
    p. 214, but is longer, consisting of twenty-six stanzas. Kinloch,
    Motherwell, and Laidlaw have also portions of it. Laidlaw, in a
    letter to Scott, January 3, 1803, says of the ballad, as sung to him
    by Walter Grieve: "He likewise sung part of a very beautiful ballad
    which I think you will not have seen.... The tune is very solemn and
    melancholy, and the effect is mixed with a considerable proportion of
    horror." See Child, No. 243.</p>

<p>The printed ballad that is in the Roxburgh Collection is, I feel
    convinced, a clumsy re-writing of the earlier ballad, so as to
    convey a moral, as its title implies, "A Warning to Married Women."
    James Harris is the demon lover. In the traditional ballad, when the
    carpenter's wife has eloped, she falls into deep depression—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"I do not weep for your gold, she said,<br>
            Nor do I weep for your fee,<br>
            But by the masthead stands my baby dead,<br>
            And I weep, I weep for my dead babie....<br>
            <br>
            "She had not a-been upon the seas<br>
            But six days of the week,<br>
            Before that she lay as cold as clay<br>
            And never a word, one word did speak.<br>
            <br>
            "They had not a-been upon the seas<br>
            Of weeks but three and four,<br>
            But down to the bottom the ship did swim<br>
            And never was heard of, heard of more."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>There is another ballad running on somewhat similar lines, "The
    Undutiful Daughter," who is in like manner enticed away; but the ship
    will not proceed, and lots are cast who is to be thrown overboard.
    The lot falls on the girl, and she is cast into the sea, but the body
    swims before the ship and reaches land first. This ballad we have
    taken down several times.</p>

<p>The last verse (six) I have added to make some sort of conclusion to
    the song.</p>

<p>What the air is to which the ballad is sung in Scotland I do not know.</p>

        class="smcap">Poor Old Horse.</span> Words and melody from Matthew Baker. The
    song is given in Bell's "Ballads of the English Peasantry," p. 184,
    as sung by the mummers in the neighbourhood of Richmond, Yorkshire.
    He says: "The rustic actor who sings this song is dressed as an old
    horse, and at the end of every verse the jaws are snapped in chorus.
    It is a fine composition, and is now (1864) printed for the first
    time." This is not so; it has long existed on Broadside by Hodges of
    Seven Dials, and Such, etc. The Midland air of the song in Mason's
    "Nursery Rhymes and Country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N23" id="Page_N23">-N23-</a></span> Songs," 1877. Mr.
    Kidston has obtained
    several versions of the song in Yorkshire and Lancashire. A fine
    setting was sung at the Folk-Song Competition at Kendal in 1903. It
    is given in <i>Folk-Song Journal</i>, vol. i. pp. 75 and 260.</p>

<p>In "Sailors' Songs and Chanties," Boosey &amp; Co., the song is given
    under the title of "The Dead Horse." In Derbyshire, at Christmas,
    boys and young men were wont, and may be still are wont, to go about,
    one dressed as a horse, with a horse's skull in his hands or affixed
    to his head; then this song was sung by the attendants and money
    asked for the feeding of the beast, and the head was made to snap
    its jaws. The song is also given in Topcliff's "Melodies of the Tyne
    and Wear," <span class="sm">N.D.</span>, but <i>circ.</i> 1815, and is also found on
    Broadsides by Such.</p>

<p>Mr. Sharp has given a version in his "Folk-Songs from Somerset," No.
    27.</p>

        class="smcap">The Dilly Song.</span> An almost endless number of versions of
    this song have been taken down, and have been sent to us. It is known
    throughout Cornwall, and is, indeed, still sung in the chapels. When
    a party of amateurs performed the "Songs of the West" in Cornwall,
    1890, the Dilly Song always provoked laughter among the good folk at
    the back of the halls. This puzzled the performers, till they learned
    that folk laughed because this was their familiar chapel hymn. In
    the text I have given the version of the words with least of the
    religious element in them. Here are some of the other versions—</p>

<p>2. "God's own Son, or Christ's Natures"; or "The strangers o'er the
    wide world rangers"; or "The lily-white maids."</p>

<p>3. "Three is all eternity"; "Three are the Thrones." The strangers
    are probably the Wise Men from the East.</p>

<p>There are similar verses in German and Flemish; a Scottish version

    Luzel, "Chansons Populaires," 1890, p. 88. There is a Mediæval Latin
    form, beginning "Unus est Deus." A Hebrew form is printed in Mendez:
    "Service for the First Night of the Passover," London, 1862; a
    Moravian form in Wenzig: "<span lang="de">Slavischer Märchen-Schatz</span>," 1857, p. 295.
    It is also sung in the <span lang="de">Eifel, Schmitz: "Sitten u. Bräuche des Eifler
Volkes</span>," Trier, 1856, p. 113. A Greek form is in Sanders: "<span lang="de">Volksleben

Flamands</span>," Gand, 1850; Villemarqué, Barzas Breis, 1846, and later
    editions.</p>

<p>The lily-white boys are probably the Gemini, or sign for Spring. In
    the "Queen-like Closet, or Rich Cabinet," 1681, are instructions for
    embroidering emblems of the months. "May is to be clothed in a robe
    of <i>white and green</i>, and his sign must be Gemini."</p>

<p>"The Ferryman in the Boat" is perhaps Charon. In other versions Five
    is the Dilly-bird, or the Dilly-hour, "when blooms the dilly-flower."</p>

<p>Some are obviously merely adopted as rhymes, as "six the crucifix."</p>

<p>In Cornwall and Devon the song goes by the name of "The Dilly Song."
    What the meaning of "Dilly" is must remain uncertain. Possibly it
    signifies the Festal Song (Welsh, <i>dillyn</i>, pretty, gay).</p>

<p>The song used to be sung by Eton boys. It was introduced by Sir
    Arthur Sullivan into "The Yeomen of the Guard"; he, I believe, heard
    it sung by a sailor. His melody bears a certain relationship to ours.
    The song requires to be sung by at least two persons, a questioner
    and the responder.</p>

        class="smcap">Country Dance.</span> This dance tune, called "The Mallard,"
    because of some silly words that go to it relative to the gobbling up
    of a mallard. It begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Oh, what have I ate, and what have I ate?<br>
            I have eaten the toe of a mallard.<br>
            <span class="i3">Toe and toe, nevins and all,</span><br>
            And I have been to ballery allery,<br>
            And so good meat was the mallard."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The singer proceeds to eat the foot, then the leg, the thigh, the
    rump, the wing, the back, the breast, the neck, the head; and then
    the dance was concluded. A Breton version in Luzel, p. 80. I have
    written fresh words to the tune.</p>

<p>This tune is in the Dorian mode. As sung by J. Masters, the E was
    sharpened in the 3rd bar but flattened on the repetition of the
    same phase in the penultimate bar. Mr. Sheppard, when arranging
    the song, flattened the E throughout. It must be one thing or the
    other. Flattened throughout, it makes a charming melody, but the last
    flattened E was probably due to the singer's memory failing him in
    the latter part of the air, but serving him at the beginning of the
    tune. Mr. Sharp has accordingly retained the E natural throughout.
    The opening phrase is similar to the Plain-Song Easter Carol, "<i><span lang="la">O
Filii et Filiæ</span></i>." This was a melody used in French folk-song for the
    welcoming in of spring. In fact, a May song. It forced its way into
    the service of the Church, and was adopted and used for the Easter
    Sequence. See Tiersot, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 361, 391. It is certainly
    curious finding the same in Devonshire folk-music. Neither Mr.
    Sheppard nor I observed it; it was pointed out by Mr. Sharp.</p>

        class="smcap">Constant Johnny.</span> Words and melody taken down from Roger
    Luxton. It was a dialogue, and so Mr. Sheppard had arranged it.
    Such lover dialogues are and were very commonly sung in farmhouses.
    Ravenscroft gives one in broad Devonshire in his "Brief Discourse,"
    1614, entitled, "Hodge Trellindle and his Zweethart Malkyn." Our
    ballad seems to be based on "Doubtful Robin and Constant Nanny,"
    <i>circ.</i> 1680, in the "Roxburgh Ballads."</p>

<p>These dialogue songs between a lover and his lass were very popular.
    Addison, in <i>The Guardian</i> of 1713, gives snatches of a West Country
    ballad of this kind, and shows how vastly superior it is to the
    pastorals of Dresden china shepherds and shepherdesses of Pope and
    Philips.</p>

        class="smcap">The Duke's Hunt.</span> Words and melody taken from James
    Olver, again at Stoke Gabriel, again at Mary Tavy, again at
    Menheniot. This is a mere cento from a long ballad, entitled "The Fox
    Chase," narrating a hunt by Villiers, second Duke of Buckingham, in
    the reign of Charles II. It is in the Roxburgh Collection, and was
    printed by W. Oury, <i>circ.</i> 1650. The ballad is there said to be sung
    "to an excellent tune, much in request." We suspect that the melody
    we give is the original tune handed down traditionally, and never
    before published. Mr. Sharp has noted down the same song and melody
    from a singer at East Harptree, Somerset.</p>

        class="smcap">The Bell Ringing.</span> Words and air from William George
    Kerswell, Two Bridges, Dartmoor; sung also by James Down, blacksmith,

        class="smcap">A Nutting we will go.</span> Taken down from J. Gerrard, an old
    man, nearly blind, at Cullyhole, near Chagford, from Robert Hard,
    and again at Menheniot, and also from James Parsons. Bunting, in his
    "Irish Melodies," 1840, gives the same tune to a fragment of the same
    words, and says that he took it down in 1792 from Duncan, a harper.
    Duncan remembered a portion of a tune he had heard, perhaps, from
    English soldiers, and eked it out with some other tune. Then came
    S. Lover, and he took this air from Bunting, and wrote to it "The
    Lowbacked Car." But the original melody is found, not only in Devon
    and Cornwall, but also in the North, and Mr. Kidson gives it in his
    "Traditional Tunes," as "With Henry Hunt we'll go," a song sung in
    Manchester in connection with the arrest of Hunt in 1819. To the same
    air was set "The Plains of Waterloo." "The Lowbacked Car" has become
    popular through its words, and the inartistic quality of a patchwork
    tune has been forgiven for their sake.</p>

<p>The words "The Nutgirl" occur on Broadsides by Fortey, Such, etc.
    See Ballads collected by Crampton, B.M. (11,621, h), and (1875, b
    19); but these are without the chorus. The printed Broadside has lost
    somewhat. For Gerard's—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"His voice rang out so clear and stout,<br>
            It made the horse-bells ring,"</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>it gives—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"His voice was so melodious,<br>
            It made the valleys ring."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The Broadside ballad consists of fourteen verses, and is very gross.
    I have had to considerably tone down the words.</p>

<p>An earlier Broadside by Pitts has the chorus.</p>

<p>The same air was employed for the ballads, "In January last, on
    Monday at Morn," for "The Brags of Washington," 1775, for "Calder
    Fair," and "To Rodney we will go." It is given in the third edition
    of "Scotch, Irish, and Foreign Airs," Glasgow, 1788.</p>

<p>A version is in <i>Folk-Song Journal</i>, vol. i. p. 127, as taken down in
    Sussex. This version begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"And as this brisk young farmer was ploughing up his land,<br>
            He called to his horses and bade them gently stand.<br>
            He sat himself down a song to begin,<br>
            His voice was so melodious, made the valleys to ring.<br>
            And as this brisk young damsel was nutting in the wood,<br>
            His voice was so melodious, it charmed her as she stood;<br>
            She had no longer power in that lonely wood to stay,<br>
            And what few nuts she'd got, poor girl, she threw them all away."</p>

    had been parish clerk of Holne for fifty years and died in 1883, over

        class="smcap">The Barley Rakings.</span> Taken down from Roger Hannaford,
    Lower Widdecombe, Dartmoor. The words exist in Broadside versions by
    Such, Bingham of Lincoln, Robertson of Wigton, etc. Such's version
    consists of six verses, the others of four. Hannaford's verses 2 and
    3 were unlike those of Bingham and Robertson, but resembled 3 and 4
    of Such. He had not 2 and 6 of Such. He had a curious line in verse
    2: "They had a mind to <i>style</i> and play" (the Anglo-Saxon <i>styllan</i>,
    to leap or dance), not found in the printed copies. As none of these
    versions would be tolerable to polite ears, Mr. Sheppard has modified
    the words considerably. The melody to which "Barley Rakings" is sung
    in other parts of England is wholly different. Ours is probably
    an early dance tune, originally in the Mixolydian Mode, which has
    undergone modification in oral transmission.</p>

    Miss Octavia L.
    Hoare. We heard the same from old Sally Satterley at Huckaby Bridge,
    Dartmoor. She was the daughter of an old crippled singing man on the
    moor. I have told the story of the way in which she as a young bride
    with her husband took possession of a house built all in one day, in
    my Dartmoor Idylls, "Jolly Lane Cott." Sally is now dead, and her
    house has been rebuilt and vulgarised. One verse, running—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"I put my finger into the bush<br>
            <span class="i1">Thinking the sweetest rose to find,</span><br>

            <span class="i1">And yet I left the rose behind,"</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>is found in "The Distressed Virgin," a ballad by Martin Parker,
    printed by J. Coles, 1646-74. Parker seems to have taken the lines
    into his ballad from one previously existing. Two of the stanzas,
    3 and 6, occur in the Scottish song, "Wally, wally up the Bank,"
    in "Orpheus Caledonicus," 1733, No. 34; the stanzas 4 and 5 in the
    song in "The Scot's Musical Museum," 1787-1803, vi. p. 582. In "The
    Wandering Lover's Garland," <i>circ.</i> 1730, are two of the verses
    worked into another ballad.</p>

<p>We took down the song a third time from William Nichols of
    Whitchurch, near Tavistock. It was a song of his grandmother's, who
    seventy years ago was hostess of the village inn.</p>

        class="smcap">The Rambling Sailor.</span> Words and music from Roger
    Hannaford. A hornpipe tune. There are several versions of this on
    Broadsides. Originally the song was "The Rambling Soldier," and
    so appears at the middle and latter end of the 18th century. Then
    some poetaster of Catnach's re-wrote it as "The Rambling Sailor,"
    destroying all the point and wit of the original, which wit and
    point were not very choice. But as in the West, the ditty is set
    to a hornpipe tune, we have retained the song as one of a sailor,
    only modifying the words where objectionable. The earliest copy of
    "The Rambling Soldier" that I have seen was in the possession of
    Dr. Barrett; a later copy, <i>circ.</i> 1820, by Whiting of Birmingham,
    Ballads, B.M. (1876, c 2). "The Rambling Sailor," by Disley, <i>circ.</i>
    1830, in Ballads collected by Crampton, B.M. (11,621), vol. viii.</p>

<p>Mr. Sharp has taken this song and air down in N. Devon and Somerset
    four or five times, in every case with a flattened 7th in the
    Mixolydian mode. Our version is clearly a modernised edition of the
    older tune.</p>

    This ballad is known throughout the length
    and breadth of Cornwall, but it is sometimes mixed up with another,
    "The Alternon Volunteer." We have taken it down at least a score of
    times. Some of those from whom we have had it are Thomas Morris,
    parish clerk of Fowey; J. Libby, coachman at Tredethy, Bodmin;
    Anthony Pascoe, Liskeard; and Anne Painter, East Looe.</p>

<p>The incident referred to in the ballad is the accidental shooting of
    William Combe or Coome of St. Agnes, at the Revel or Village Feast at
    Crantock in 1721. In the parish register at this date is the entry:
    "William Coome of S<span class="super">t</span> Agnes, a youth about 20 years of age, who att
    the ffeast att this Parish rec<span class="super">d</span> his death of a shot; buried May
    17."</p>

<p>Crantock Feast is on May 16.</p>

<p>There are a good many more verses in the original than are here
    given. They have no poetic merit; and the tune is not very original,
    but has a certain plaintive sweetness.</p>

    and the words belong to a similar custom.
    Compare with this "Lemonday" in our "Garland of Country Songs."
    Originally doubtless an Æolian, perhaps a Dorian tune, that has been
    corrupted and modernised.</p>

<p>A Broadside version has nine stanzas, and ends—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"So here's a health to the bird in the bush,<br>

            Let their parents say little or much."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The same ballad in Lyle's Collection, 1827, "From Recollection; air
    plaintive and pastoral." A Broadside version of this ballad in nine
    stanzas by Williamson of Newcastle. Song and air are given also in
    Kidson's "Traditional Tunes," 1891, as taken down in Yorkshire; but
    that version of the melody is inferior to ours. A Welsh version of
    the tune comes nearer to ours.</p>

        class="smcap">The Green Bed.</span> Taken down from J. Masters. We heard "The
    Outlandish Knight" sung to the same melody by Richard Gregory on
    Dartmoor. "The Green Bed" exists as a Broadside ballad in six double
    verses. Mr. Sheppard has re-written the ballad, and has condensed
    the story. The air somewhat resembles "The Girl I left behind me."
    See "Philander's Garland," <i>circ.</i> 1780, B.M. (11,621, c 4). See

        class="smcap">The Loyal Lover.</span> Words and air from Sally Satterley,
    Huckaby Bridge, again from Anne Roberts, Scobbetor, Widdecombe. The
    words exist in part in "Collin and Phœbe's Garland," B.M. (11,621,
    c 5). But this has two verses only. See also <i>The Lover's Magazine</i>,
    London, 1740, B.M. (11,621, c 26). This air has been harmonised in
    the Dorian mode, though as the 6th of the scale is absent, it might
    have been treated as an Æolian tune.</p>

    Lew Down; and James Oliver, Launceston. Matthew Baker said that he
    learned it, when aged ten, in 1827.</p>

<p>The ballad was printed by Keys of Devonport, <i>circ.</i> 1830, with four
    verses, of which verse 3 was an importation from another ballad. In
    other Broadside versions, the short original, consisting of four
    verses only, has been swelled out with scraps from other ballads to
    fill available space. Broadsides by Catnach, Whiting of Birmingham,
    etc.</p>

    Logan's "Pedlar's Pack," 1869, p. 241. The last verse has had to be

        class="smcap">Tobacco is an Indian Weed.</span> This old and famous song was
    written, it is thought, by George Withers, as Mr. Collier found a
    copy of it in MS. of the date of James I., with his initials to it.
    It is found in "Merry Drollery Complete," 1670, and on a Broadside
    dated 1672. We give the tune to which it is sung around Dartmoor
    and in Cornwall; this is entirely distinct from that to which it is
    sung elsewhere, as printed by Chappell, ii. p. 564, which is the
    air given by D'Urfey in his "Pills to Purge Melancholy," 1719, iii.
    292. A Somerset version was sung at the Folk-Song Competition at
    Frome, 1904. Snatches of the song are given in "Handy Andy," so that
    we may assume that it is also well known among the Irish peasantry;
    another instance of the way in which English songs have travelled
    into Ireland. We took down our tune from John Potter, Merripit,
    Postbridge, and from Anne Roberts, Scobbetor, and H. Westaway,
    Belstone; also one obtained from an old man at Newton Abbot, sent to
    me.</p>

<p>In the original ballad, reprinted in Bell's "Songs and Ballads of the
    English Peasantry," there are many more stanzas than we can give here.</p>

    Sally Satterley.</p>

<p>The earliest copy in print with which I am acquainted is in "The New
    Pantheon Concert," 1773, B.M. (11,621, e 6). A re-writing of the
    theme is on a Broadside by Such, "When I heard he was married I stood
    not alone"; it is No. 592. See also a "Collection of Old Ballads," in
    the B.M., vol. i. p. 490, "The Forlorn Lover."</p>

<p>Mr. C. Sharp has obtained a fine air to the same words, and has
    published it in "Folk-Songs from Somerset," No. 20.</p>

    Hurell, the blind organist at Chagford, as he heard it sung by a
    carpenter, William Beare, in 1875. The words were very coarse,
    consequently Mr. Sheppard re-wrote the song. The air was used by
    A.S. Rich, without its most characteristic passages, for Hunneman's
    comic "Old King Cole," pub. <i>circ.</i> 1830. Much the same tune is in
    Akerman's "Wiltshire Tales," 1853, as a Wiltshire Harvest Home, p.
    132. Harmonised in the Æolian mode, though the seventh of the scale
    is absent.</p>

        class="smcap">Death and the Lady.</span> This was first sent to me by Captain
    Hall Munro, of Ingesdon House, Newton Abbot, as sung by an old man
    there. Subsequently we obtained the same from Roger Hannaford. This
    is quite different from the "Dialogue of Death and the Lady," found
    in black letter Broadsides, and given by Bell in his "Songs of the
    English Peasantry," p. 32. The tune to this latter is given by
    Chappell, i. p. 167. In Carey's "Musical Century," 1738, is given the
    air of "Death and the Lady" as "an old tune." But this melody and
    ours have nothing in common.</p>

<p>What is the signification of "branchey tree" in connection with
    Death, I am at a loss to say. "Death and the Lady" was one of the
    ballads sung by Farmer Williams in "The Vicar of Wakefield."</p>

        class="smcap">Both Sexes Give Ear to My Fancy.</span> This old song is
    a favourite with the peasantry throughout England. The words are
    printed in Bell's "Songs of the English Peasantry," p. 231. He says,
    "We have had considerable trouble in procuring a copy of the old
    song, which used, in former days, to be very popular with aged people
    resident in the North of England. It has been long out of print,
    and handed down traditionally. By the kindness of Mr. S. Swindells,
    printer, Manchester, we have been favoured with an ancient printed
    copy." In the original the song consists of ten verses. The earliest
    copy of it that I know is in "The Lady's Evening Book of Pleasure,"
    about 1740. It will be found in a collection of garlands made by Mr.
    J. Bell about 1812, and called by him "The Eleemosynary Emporium."
    It is in the British Museum. The air is found in "Vocal Music, or
    the Songster's Companion," 2nd ed., 1772, to the song, "Farewell, Ye
    Green Fields and Sweet Groves," p. 92. It was taken into "The Tragedy
    of Tragedies, or Tom Thumb," 1734, as the air to "In Hurry, Posthaste
    for a Licence," and was attributed to Dr. Arne. In "Die Familie
    Mendelssohn," vol. ii., is a scrap of music written down by Felix
    Mendelssohn, dated Leipzig, 16th August 1840, which is identical with
    the first few bars of this melody. But the earliest form of the air
    is in J.S. Bach's "Comic Cantata," where a peasant sings it.</p>

<p>We took the song down from John Rickards, Lamerton, and again from
    J. Benney, Menheniot. Mr. Kidson prints a Yorkshire version in his
    "Traditional Tunes," 1891. Miss L. Broadwood has noted it down from
    the singing of a baker at Cuckfield, Sussex. Dr. Barrett gives our
    melody to "The Gallant Hussar," No. 13. We have also taken it down to
    this ballad; so has Mr. Sharp in Somerset.</p>

    Broadside copy of the ballad exists, printed by Jennings, of
    Waterlane, London, <i>circ.</i> 1790.</p>

<p>The same theme is used in a ballad in the Pepysian Collection. See
    Ebsworth, "Roxburgh Ballads," vii. 231. Each verse ends—</p>

        class="smcap">Among the New-Mown Hay.</span> Bell, in his "Ballads and Songs
    of the Peasantry," p. 223, gives this song. He says that it is "a
    village version of an incident which occurred in the Cecil family."
    Tennyson composed his "Lord of Burleigh" on the same topic. So did
    Moore his song, "You remember Helen, the hamlet's pride." But it may
    well be questioned whether either of these compositions comes up to
    the grace of the little "village version" of the tale.</p>

<p>The ballad, however, is probably earlier than the Cecil marriage, and
    refers to some other legendary mésalliance. Henry Cecil, afterwards
    Earl and still later first Marquis of Exeter, saw, loved, and
    married a farmer's daughter named Sarah Hoggins, at Bolas Magna in
    Staffordshire, in 1790, he under the assumed name of John Jones. She
    was then aged seventeen, and he aged thirty-seven. Moreover, he was
    married at the time to Miss Vernon, a Worcestershire lady, to whom
    he had been united in 1776. In 1791, Henry Cecil obtained a divorce
    from his wife, Emma Vernon, and then was married in his proper name
    to Sarah Hoggins, at St. Mildred's, Bread Street, in the City of
    London. Not fully six years later the "Cottage Countess" died; and
    after three years the widower espoused a divorcée, sometime wife of
    the eighth Duke of Hamilton. Happily no question as to the legitimacy
    of the children arose. Henry, the eldest, was not born till 1793. He
    died the same year; but his brother, Brownlow, born two years later,
    lived to succeed his father in 1804.</p>

<p>These plain facts take away most of the romance of the story of
    the "Cottage Countess." Moreover, Henry Cecil did not meet his
    Sarah among the new-mown hay. He arrived at Bolas in a chaise in a
    snow-storm, late in November 1788, and was lodged for a few nights in
    the farm. There he saw Sarah, who with friends was dancing. She was
    then only fifteen and a half years old. Cecil left, but returned in
    eighteen months and married her, as already said, under an assumed
    name, and before he was quit of his first wife. The whole story has
    been told in <i>Chambers's Edinburgh Journal</i>, part 60 (sixth series),
    December 1, 1902.</p>

    <span class="smcap">I'll Build Myself a Gallant Ship.</span> The words are a cento
    from a long ballad. The complete song was taken down from J. Watts,
    quarryman, Thrushleton. The entire ballad is in Logan's "Pedlar's
    Pack," p. 23. There are several Broadside versions. A Scottish
    version in Herd, "Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs," 1776, ii. p.
    2. The air to which this is sung in Scotland is that to which Burns
    composed "Of a' the airts the wind can blaw." Joyce gives an Irish
    version in his "Ancient Irish Music," No. 68. Besides Watts' ballad,
    we had the fragment we give to the same air from Richard Cleave,
    since dead, at the "Forest Inn," Huckaby Bridge. Never shall I forget
    the occasion. Mr. Bussell and I drove across Dartmoor in winter in
    a furious gale of wind and rain to Huckaby in quest of an old man
    who, we had been informed, was a singer. We found the fellow, but he
    yielded nothing, and our long journey would have been fruitless, had
    we not caught Richard Cleave and obtained from him this air, which
    drive cost me a bronchitis attack that held me a prisoner for six
    weeks.</p>

<p>The song is given under the title "The Lowlands of Holland," in the
    <i>Folk-Song Journal</i>, vol. i. p. 97, as taken down in Sussex.</p>

            Pruh, pruh, pruh, pruh, pruh, pruh, pruh, tal-dal daw."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Printed by T. Passinger (1670-86) at the Seven Stars on London
    Bridge. The ballad is also found in the Rawlinson Collection and
    elsewhere. It was afterwards sung in a shortened form at the concerts
    in Marylebone Gardens, and is printed in "The Marylebone Concert,"
    <span class="sm">N.D.</span></p>

<p>In the heading to the old ballad we have—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"A country swain of little wit, one day<br>
            Did kill his cow, because she went astray."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>But it is probable that the song originally turned on a different
    theme. On the 9th September 1605, a man was killed by a Protestant
    in the Rue de la Harpe, at Paris, for singing the song "De Colas."
    This song was composed by a seditious faction, with the intent of
    provoking the Huguenots, upon the subject of a cow which had walked
    into one of their conventicles during the performance of divine
    service. The cow, which belonged to a poor peasant named Colas, was
    killed by the Huguenots for her sacrilegious act. Thereupon the
    Catholics made a collection in every town and village in France to
    raise a sum for the indemnification of Colas. The day after the
    murder the singing of the song of "Colas his Cow," was forbidden
    under the penalty of the gallows, and it was even dangerous for
    anyone to hum the tune in the street ("Concert Room Anecdotes," 1825,
    ii. p. 230). The song must have been brought to England and adapted
    to English words after the Restoration, and as the story of the
    occasion of the killing of the cow was forgotten, it was altered. The
    tune is very old, and we had it from an aged woman at Kingsweare,
    who sang "The Abbot of Canterbury" to it. But this has its own tune,
    given by Chappell, i. p. 348. I have added the final verse.</p>

    Mr. Shepherd
    wrote fresh words. The original began—</p>

<div class="center">

<p>The ballad is published by Such as "The Young and Single Sailor," No.
    126. It is also in "The Vocal Library," London, 1822, p. 525. It was
    printed on Broadside by Catnach as "The Sailor's Return." We obtained
    it again from James Parsons.</p>

    and
    melody from Mary Langworthy, Stoke Fleming. We have taken this down
    from two other singers, but not to the same tune; one J. Doidge, of
    Chillaton, gave us an air characteristic and good. Miss Broadwood has
    the song in her "County Songs," pp. 146-7, but to a different melody.</p>

<p>In all the versions taken down from oral recitation, the word is Boy
    and not Bird, but <i>Bird</i> is the original word. The ballad was printed
    by J. Coles, 1646-74, and by W. Thackeray, 1660-1680, and is in the
    Douce Collection of early Broadsides in the Bodleian Library; also in
    the Pepysian Collection, and is printed by Ebsworth in the Roxburgh
    Ballads, viii. p. 359.</p>

<p>It was originally sung to "Cupid's Trepan," also called "Up the Green
    Forest," and "Bonny, Bonny Bird." This air is given by Chappell, ii.
    p. 557, but this differs from our tune entirely, as also from that
    given by Miss Broadwood. The ballad has not, as yet, been traced
    earlier than the reign of Charles II. It begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Once I did love a bonny brave bird,<br>
            <span class="i1">And thought he had been all my own;</span><br>

    Samuel Fone. We got the
    melody also from Sally Satterley, but with her the words were in
    confusion. The ballad runs on the same lines, and is almost identical
    with "The Lady who fell in love with a 'Prentice Boy," printed as
    a Broadside by Pitts, 1790-1810; also by Harkness of Preston. A
    copy in the British Museum (1876, d). This ballad begins like that
    of "Cupid's Garden," which is well known. But the ballad is a mere
    cooking up by a balladmonger of the earlier theme, and very badly
    done.</p>

<p>The melody is actually the same as that of "Love's Tale" in our
    "Garland of Country Song."</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_108"></a><a

    Taken down from a good many singers on and
    around Dartmoor. The melody is in the Mixolydian mode, and is very
    early and rugged, far older than the period of Paul Jones himself.
    Mr. C. Sharp says: "In my opinion the tune should perhaps never be
    harmonised at all. The whole air is cast in the chord of the dominant
    7th, and, in the opinion of most authorities, this chord should end
    the song; but in view of the popular preference for a concord rather
    than a discord as the concluding harmony, I have ended with the usual
    cadence."</p>

<p>Paul Jones was the terror of our coasts; he was born near
    Kirkcudbright in 1747. His real name was John Paul. When the rupture
    took place between Great Britain and America, he enlisted under the
    Revolutionary flag, and assumed the name of Paul Jones. His daring
    disposition, and his knowledge of the British coast, pointed him out
    as a fitting leader in marauding schemes. Towards the end of 1777
    he was actively employed, as commander, in fitting out the <i>Ranger</i>
    privateer, mounting eighteen guns, and manned with a crew of 150 men.
    We have not the space for narrating his daring exploits; his life has
    often been written, and a good notice of him will be found in the
    "Dictionary of National Biography." The fight described in the ballad
    took place on September 23, 1779. The body of Paul Jones was removed
    from Paris, where he died, to America in 1905.</p>

<p>The ballad is found on Broadsides. It is given by Logan in his
    "Pedlar's Pack," p. 32. Dr. Barrett, in his "English Folk-Songs," No.
    33, has the ballad to the tune we have given here to "<a

        Kerchief</a>," to which Paul Jones is quite unsuited.</p>

        class="smcap">The Merry Haymakers.</span> This quaint carol-like song was
    taken down from John Woodrich, who learned it, about 1850, and
    he says that it was his father's favourite song, also from James
    Parsons. Neither knew the words in their entirety, but they may be
    found in "West Country Garlands," B.M. (11,621, b 11), and among
    the Broadsheets of Pitts, about the beginning of the nineteenth
    century, beginning "In the merry month of June." The words also in
    Bell's "Ballads of the English Peasantry," p. 171. Dr. Brushfield of
    Budleigh Salterton has kindly sent me a MS. copy of the end of the
    seventeenth century or early in the eighteenth. The words, however,
    did not fit the tune comfortably, and I was constrained to re-write
    the song.</p>

<p>"The Merry Haymakers" is in D'Urfey's "Pills," and as a Broadside
    printed by C.B. (Bates), 1695, was priced in Russell Smith's

    <div class="poem">
        <p>"In Beverley Town a maid did dwell,<br>
            A buxom lass, I knew her well.<br>

</div>

<p>It is a coarse ballad, and Mr. Sheppard re-wrote it. The first phrase
    in the melody is apparently a modernised edition of an older one. The
    rest of the air is ancient, and in the Mixolydian mode.</p>

        class="smcap">The Marigold.</span> This ballad was first taken down by
    Davies Gilbert in 1830 from an old man named John Hockin, in his
    eighty-sixth year, at St. Erth, Cornwall. The melody, which is very
    early, was, curiously enough, used by William Aggett for Hook's song,
    "On board the ninety-eight." Hook was born in 1746, and the melody
    is probably two centuries earlier than his time. There was another
    Bristol ballad, "The Honour of Bristol, showing how the Angel Gabriel
    of Bristol fought with three Spanish Ships, who boarded us Seven
    times, wherein we cleared our Decks, and killed Five hundred of their
    men, and wounded many more, and made them flye into Cales when we
    lost but three men, to the Honour of the Angel Gabriel of Bristol,"
    priced in Russell Smith's Catalogue at £2, 12s. 6d.</p>

<p>We have taken down the ballad, "Come all ye worthy Christian men,"
    to this melody, which is in the Dorian mode. A fragment of this
    latter ballad is given in <i>Folk-Song Journal</i>, vol. i. p. 74, taken
    down in Sussex, in five verses. We have had it twice: once from J.
    Dingle, Coryton, and once as learned in 1820 by George Radford, from
    a blind fiddler at Washfield, near Tiverton, and "pricked down" by
    H. Pinkney, gardener, Washfield. Mr. Sharp has also met with it in
    Rackenford, N. Devon. The air in Sussex is not the same.</p>

<p>In "Hakluyt's Voyages," vol. iii. (1600), is an account of "The
    Voyage of the ship called the Marigold of Mr. Hill of Redrife unto
    Cape Breton and beyond, to the latitude of 44 degrees and a half,
    1593, written by R<span class="super">d</span> Fisher, Master Hille's man of Redriffe."</p>

<p>So also Hakluyt mentions "the Marigold 70 tunnes in burthen,
    furnished with 20 men, whereof ten were mariners," which is stated
    to have "departed out of Falmouth, the 1st June, 1593," commanded
    by Richard Strong, "bound for an island within the straights of S.
    Peter on the backe side of Newfoundland to the S.W. in the lat. of 47
    degrees."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N30" id="Page_N30">-N30-</a></span></p>

<p>In Latimer's 17th century "Annals of Bristol" is mention made of a
    ship "The Marigold," under the date 1627-8, of seventy tons, owned by
    Mr. Ellis. It was granted letters of marque to prey upon the enemy's
    commerce; but no mention is made of Sir Thomas Merrifield. The
    <i>Redrife</i> above is Redcliffe, Bristol. Bristol was spelled <i>Bristow</i>
    in maps of the city published in 1568 and 1610, but in one of 1671 it
    is spelled Bristoll.</p>

<p>I have been unable to find Sir Thomas Merrifield in any lists of
    knights; but before the reign of James I. no official record of
    knights was kept.</p>

        class="smcap">Arthur le Bride</span>. Taken down from Sam Fone, Mary Tavy,
    by Mr. Bussell, in 1892. Sam told us that this was his father's
    favourite song. He had learned it from his father when he was quite
    a child, for the elder Fone deserted his family, and was never
    heard of again. But one day Sam, when aged eighteen, saw a workman
    standing at a cottage door, talking to someone within, and he had
    his hand against the door-post, clutching it as he leaned forward.
    Sam exclaimed: "That's my father's hand!" The man turned about, and
    without showing his face, walked away. When Sam came from his work in
    the evening he made enquiries, and ascertained that a stranger had
    been lodging in the cottage for a few nights, but was gone. He asked
    the woman of the house about her lodger. "Well," said she, "I don't
    know his name, nor nothing about him. But he asked me for a tallow
    candle, and melted it up into his boots." "That was my father. It was
    a trick of his," said Sam, promptly. And that was the last ever seen
    of the man.</p>

<p>There was one more verse in the original, omitted to reduce the
    lengthy ballad to singable proportions.</p>

    This song was taken down from Peter Sandry,
    St. Ervan's. He had a bad cold, and could not reach the upper
    notes. But we got the same tune from Mr. Jas. Ellis, Chaddlehanger,
    Lamerton, and also from Miss Templer, from the singing of harvesters
    in 1834; but in both these latter cases to the words of "Green
    Broom." A copy of the ballad will be found in a "Garland," B.M.,
    11,621, c 3; but this has a chorus to it—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Jack my master, sing you well,<br>
            Very well, with my derry down,<br>
            <span class="i2">With my Down, down, down."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>I have been compelled to re-write most of the song, which in the
    original is very gross. It is certainly an ancient composition.</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_114"></a><a

        class="smcap">The Queen of Hearts.</span> Sung by a workman engaged on the
    Burrow-Tor reservoir at Sheepstor, the water supply for Plymouth,
    1894. A quaint little song. It has been printed on Broadside by
    Bachelar, B.M., in vol. vi. p. 110, of several volumes of Broadsides
    I gave to the B.M. This begins—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"O my poor heart, my poor heart is breaking<br>
            For a false young man, or I am mistaking:<br>
            He is gone to Ireland, for a long time to tarry,<br>
            Some Irish girl I am afraid he will marry."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>This is obviously an addition to fill out space in the Broadside. The
    ballad has a flavour of the period of Charles II.</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_115"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_115_THE_OWL">115.</a>
    <span class="smcap">The Owl.</span> This song occurs in part in King Henry VIII.'s
    music-book, "Deuteromelia," published in 1609. It was set by Mr.
    Freeman as a glee in "The Essex Harmony," vol. i. 1767, p. 8. In
    Beaumont and Fletcher's play, "The Knight of the Burning Pestle,"
    1635, Old Merrythought trolls out snatches of songs, and amongst
    others—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Nose, nose, jolly red nose,<br>
            And who gave thee this jolly red nose?<br>
            Cinnamon, ginger, nutmegs, and cloves,<br>
            And they gave me this jolly red nose."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Bussell noted down the melody from James Olver, tanner of
    Launceston, in 1889. Of the words, Olver could not recall the line
    that follows</p>

<p class="center">"And all the day long the Owl is asleep,"</p>

<p>and I have had to supply what lacked.</p>

<p>I give this song because it is interesting to note the changes that
    the air has undergone since it was performed as a Three Man's song
    before King Henry VIII. It will be noticed that Olver has not got all
    that portion of the song beginning "To whom drink'st thou." Chappell
    has given "Of all the Birds," in i. p. 75. On the other hand, in
    "Deuteromelia," only the first verse is given; Olver had three. A
    re-writing of the song "Of all the Birds on Bush or Tree" in "The
    Thrush," London, 1830, has two stanzas. The second concerns the lark.</p>

    <span class="smcap">My Mother did so before Me.</span> This song is based on the
    old English ditty "My Father was Born before Me," as may be seen at
    once by comparing the first few lines—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"I am a lusty, lively lad<br>
            <span class="i1">Now come to one and twenty,</span><br>

            <span class="i1">My father did so before me."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The first appearance of this ballad is in Thomas Jordan's "London
    Triumphant," 1672. It was taken by D'Urfey into his "Pills to Purge
    Melancholy," vol. i., 1699 and 1707. The air appears in the "Dancing
    Master" as "Jamaca," 4th edition, 1670, and in those subsequent.</p>

<p>The tune we give was taken down to the song from S. Fone by Mr.
    Sheppard in 1895.</p>

<p>"My Mother did so before Me" occurs without music in "The
    Nightingale," a song-book published in Edinburgh, 1776, and is given
    by Logan in his "Pedlar's Pack," 1869, from a chap-book of 1804. It
    occurs also on a Broadside by Pitts of Seven Dials. It is also in
    "The Quaver," Lond. 1831. The tune we have taken down is certainly
    based on the early air as given in the "Dancing Master." It is in
    Chappell, ii. p. 446.</p>

        class="smcap">A Week's Work well done.</span> This popular song, relished by
    married men, was taken down from Richard Hard a little over a month
    before he died. In the original it is much longer. There are in all
    eleven verses. The first four are concerned with the happiness of the
    man previous to his marriage. But I find that most singers begin with
    the fifth verse.</p>

<p>The ballad is found in "West Country Garlands," date <i>circ.</i> 1760,
    B.M., 1161, b 11.</p>

<p>It actually begins thus—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"O when that I was a bachelor brave,<br>
            Enjoying of all that my soul could have;<br>
            My silver and guineas I then let fly,<br>
            I cock'd my beaver, and, who but I?<br>
            <br>
            "I roved about, and I roved awhile,<br>
            Till all the ladies did on me smile;<br>
            From noble lady to country Joan,<br>
            Both gentle and simple, were all mine own.<br>
            <br>
            "My rapier it was a Bilboa blade,<br>
            My coat and waistcoat were overlaid<br>
            With silver spangles, so neat and gay,<br>
            As I were a king in some country play.<br>
            <br>
            "Besides, I had such a flattering tongue,<br>
            The ladies laughed whene'er I sung;<br>
            I had a voice so sweet and fine<br>
            That every lady's heart was mine."</p>

        href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_118_THE_OLD_MAN_CANT_KEEP_HIS_WIFE_AT_HOME">118.</a>
    <span class="smcap">The Old Man can't keep his Wife at Home.</span> The curious
    rugged melody was taken down from a very old fiddler named William
    Andrews, at Sheepstor, by Mr. Bussell. The old fellow did not recall
    all the words, but remembered the story. According to his account
    this was a dance tune to which the performers sang in accompaniment
    to the music and tramp of feet.</p>

<p>I have had to re-compose the ballad from the fragment and the story.
    It bears a family resemblance to "The Old Couple" given in "The
    Garland of Country Song," p. 100. In the story the old man locks his
    wife out. She threatens to drown herself, and throws a stone into
    the well. The old man, when he hears the splash, descends, opens
    the door, and goes forth to see whether his wife really has drowned
    herself. At once she slips in at the open door and locks him out. The
    story is very ancient. It occurred in the lost Sanscrit book of tales
    of which Persian and Arabic and Turkish versions exist, and which
    filtered into Europe through Greek and Latin and Hebrew translations.
    This story came into Dolopathos and the Seven Wise Masters. The
    French and Latin versions were made in the 13th century. But the
    story had already got to Europe through the converted Jew, Peter
    Alphonsus, who inserted it in his "Disciplina Clericalis," written
    in 1062. From this it got into some of the versions of the "Gesta
    Romanorum," and finally into Boccaccio's "Decameron," seventh day,
    tale 4.</p>

<p>To give the whole story in ballad form would have made the ballad too
    long; I have therefore reduced it to three verses, and have given it,
    from the man's point of view, a happier termination.</p>

<p>The tune is clearly a bagpipe air with drone.</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_119"></a><a

        class="smcap">Sweet, Farewell.</span> Taken down from Samuel Fone, of Mary
    Tavy, in 1889, the music noted by Mr. Bussell. Fone had forgotten the
    two last lines of verse 1 and the two first of verse 2. The air is
    pleasant, but the words are naught.</p>


<p class="tp"><a id="NOTE_120"></a><a
        href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56625/56625-h/56625-h.htm#No_120_OLD_ADAM_THE_POACHER">120.</a> <span
        class="smcap">Old Adam, the Poacher.</span> This curious melody was taken
    down by Mr. Bussell from the fiddling of William Andrews, Sheepstor.
    We saw the old man a little over a year before his death. He brought
    out and lent us a collection of MS. violin tunes, but all of these
    were well-known, old-fashioned dance airs. Then he played to us
    several not in his book that were traditional at Sheepstor. This was
    one of them, a dance tune; but he could not recall the words, only he
    knew that they told of the adventures of "Old Adam, the Poacher." Mr.
    Sheppard arranged this for "English Minstrelsy," but did not perceive
    that the first four lines of air have to be repeated to complete the
    tune; and in taking the melody from the fiddler, one could not detect
    at first, not knowing the words, where the tune precisely ended. It
    seems, however, obvious that there is a repeat of the first strain. I
    wrote the words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_N32" id="Page_N32">-N32-</a></span></p>

        class="smcap">Evening Prayer.</span> Some fifty years ago this was the
    only, or almost the only, prayer used by village children. It was
    said or chanted far more extensively than the Lord's Prayer. The
    children had, however, cut down the hymn to one verse. The complete
    song, as "Prayer of the Week," was obtained from an old woman in the
    workhouse at Tavistock. Where the passage occurs purporting to come
    from the Epistles of St. Peter it would be hard to say. The tune, as
    it stands, is in the Major mode, and is so harmonised. But if the
    last note were G instead of E<span title="flat">&#9837;</span>—as, indeed, it is in the two
    previous repetitions of the same phrase—the melody would then be in
    the Phrygian mode. The termination in E<span title="flat">&#9837;</span> is probably a modern
    corruption.</p>

<p>Something very much like this prayer is found throughout Europe. Here
    is the Quercy version, sung also in Poitou, Gascony, and Brittany—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Father of habit, our Lord salutes you.<br>
            He is at the head, He is at the feet;<br>
            <span class="i2">He is now, He is hereafter.</span><br>
            On the bed, when I lie,<br>
            Five angels are me by,<br>
            Two to head and two to feet,<br>

            I need not fear fire and flame and sudden death," etc.</p>

</div>

<p>Daymard, "Chansons Populaires," Cahors, 1889. It is probably the
    "White Paternoster" referred to in "The Miller's Tale," by Chaucer—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Lord Jhesu Crist, and Seynte Benedight,<br>
            Bless this hous from every wikkede wight,<br>
            Fro nyghtesmare werye the witte (white) Pater-noster."</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>White, in his "Way to the True Church," 1624, insists on "the
    prodigious ignorance" which he found among his parishioners when
    he entered on his ministrations. He gives what he calls "The White
    Paternoster":—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"White Paternoster, Saint Peter's brother,<br>
            What hast i' th' one hand? White book leaves.<br>
            What hast i' th' t'other hand? Heaven yate keyes.<br>
            Open heaven yates, and streike hell yates:<br>
            And let every crysome child creep to its own mother,<br>
            <span class="i6">White Paternoster, Amen."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>This, however, is not the same. But in the Magical Treatise,
    "<span lang="la">Enchiridion Papæ Leonis</span>," Rome, 1660, it runs—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
    <p>"<span lang="fr">Petit Pate nôtre blanche que Dieu fit, que Dieu dit, que
Dieu mit en Paradis. Au soir me allant coucher je trouve
trois anges à mon lit couchés, un aux pieds, deux au
chevet, la bonne Vierge Marie au milieu, qui me dit que je
me arrette, que rien ne doute</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>This was to be recited thrice at eve, thrice in the morning, and it
    would secure Paradise.</p>

<p>The White Paternoster was proscribed by the Church as superstitious:
    "<span lang="es">Le Tableau de la vida del parfet Crestia</span>," by P. Amilha, 1703, p.
    234. See Victor Hugo, "<span lang="fr">Les Miserables</span>," iv. p. 117.</p>

<p>A form used on the Cornish moors, and repeated by a boy at Alternon,
    runs—</p>

<div class="center">
    <div class="poem">
        <p>"Ding dong, the parson's bell,<br>
            <span class="i2">Very well my mother.</span><br>
            I shall be buried in the old churchyard,<br>
            <span class="i2">By the side of my dear brother.</span><br>
            My coffin shall be black,<br>
            Two little angels at my back,<br>

            And two to carry my soul away.<br>

            <span class="i2">When I am quite forgotten."</span></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>The boy was taught this by his aunt.</p>

<p>In the "Townley Mysteries," p. 91, the shepherds watching their
    flocks by night repeat a form of this prayer. See also Ady's "Candle
    in the Dark," London, 1650, p. 58; also a paper in the <i>Archæologia</i>,
