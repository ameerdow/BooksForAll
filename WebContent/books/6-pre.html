    <h1 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h1></div>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;">A FEW WORDS ABOUT HAMEL.</p>

<p class="pindent">A spoiled woman, an extremely cross Englishman,
    who was her husband, and a smiling
    mandarin, who was their host, sat on the prow
    of a Chinese junk. They were rather a silent
    trio. The mandarin knew, or pretended he knew,
    no English. The Englishman pretended to know
    considerable Chinese, but, as a matter of fact,
    knew almost none. The two men were about
    equally fluent in rather bad French, and were
    wont to use it as the medium for a good deal of
    conversation, when they were alone. But to-night,
    with the spoiled woman sitting between
    them, neither seemed to have a word to say. Perhaps
    they both felt embarrassed by what to both
    of them must have seemed the ridiculousness of
    the situation.</p>

<p class="pindent">The junk had left Shanghai a few days before.
    It was bound for Korea, where the mandarin was
    going on business—on business for the Emperor
    of China. The party on the boat, not to mention
    servants and such, included the mandarin, the
    mandarin’s wife, the Englishman, the Englishman’s
    wife, and a young man named John Stewart-Leigh.</p>

<p class="pindent">As I have said, his excellency the mandarin
    was going to Korea on business. The spoiled
    woman was going for pleasure; her husband
    was going because he thought he ought to, and
    the mandarin’s wife was going because she had
    to. Stewart-Leigh would probably have found it
    very hard to tell even himself just why he was on
    board. “It’s as good a way of spending my leave
    as another, since I am too poor to go home just
    now,” he had said to a brother subaltern in Hong
    Kong, “and it will be a perfect charity to Q.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Q., the spoiled woman’s husband, had
    been stopped by a friend a few weeks before
    as he came down the steps of the Shanghai
    club.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I say, Q.,” cried the other, “what is this?
    I hear that you are going to Korea, and in his
    junk, with Ja Hong Ting. I say, it isn’t true, is
    it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course it’s true,” Q. had replied gloomily.
    “That mad wife of mine has inveigled the poor
    old mandarin into inviting her. She insists upon
    going, and I am going along to chaperon her.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Q.’s had been living in China for almost
    a year. They had known Ja Hong Ting when
    he had been the Chinese minister at one of the
    European capitals. Indeed, an uncle of Mrs. Q.’s
    (she was not unmixedly English) had been the
    European secretary of the legation of which Ja
    Hong Ting had been the head. The acquaintance
    that had begun on the continent of Europe
    (and which between the then-girl and the Chinaman
    had been rather a friendly acquaintance)
    had developed in Pekin, as friendships between
    Chinese and Europeans don’t often develop.
    Mr. Q., who alternately laughed and grumbled at
    his wife’s odd tastes, secretly shared them. He
    was a grave, quiet man; as a rule, almost
    taciturn. He was a deal of a philosopher, though
    no one but his wife ever suspected it, and he had
    become very much interested in Ja Hong Ting
    and the glimpses of real China and of real Chinese
    life which had been afforded him through his
    acquaintance with the mandarin.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Ja Hong Ting and the Q.’s had first met
    in the drawing-room of one of the European
    Legations at Pekin, Ja Hong Ting had exclaimed,
    as he bowed over and over Mrs. Q.’s hand,
    “I am so glad you are here. Now you shall
    know my wife.” (His wife had not been
    with him in Europe.) “You shall teach her
    English, and she shall teach you Chinese. I
    entreat you and your husband to come to my
    yamun to-morrow, and there you and she shall be
    made great friends.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Ja Hong Ting had not spoken in English, of
    course.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Q.’s had gone to the yamun the next day,
    but Ja Hong Ting’s programme had not been
    altogether carried out. His wife had been
    obedient, as most Chinese wives are, but she had
    taken a dislike to the Englishman, and a most
    violent dislike to the Englishwoman. She was
    civil then and afterwards (at least, in the mandarin’s
    presence), but she never warmed to her
    husband’s European friends, most especially not
    to the lady. She taught Mrs. Q. no Chinese, at
    least not voluntarily; and from Mrs. Q. she
    learned no English.</p>

<p class="pindent">Some months after, Ja Hong Ting had called
    upon the Q.’s in Shanghai. He stayed to dinner,
    and as they sat down, said to Mrs. Q., “Do you
    know where Korea is?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course I know where Korea is,” replied his
    hostess.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” interrupted Q., “so do I. It is one
    of the few places that my wife has not dragged
    me to yet.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ah, yes! I forgot,” said the mandarin, turning
    again to his hostess. “Yes, I remember, you
    are a great geographer and a traveller. But I do
    not suppose you will ever go to Korea. I should
    think it the last place pleasant for you to visit. I
    have been there a number of times, and I am
    going next month. The Emperor is sending me
    with a message to the King of Korea.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs. Q. pushed her plate of untasted soup
    from her, and cried, “Oh!” Mr. Q. knitted
    his brows and sighed. He saw trouble in the
    distance.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You pity me,” said the mandarin.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Pity you!” said the woman. “Ah! don’t
    you think the Emperor would send me in your
    place?”</p>
