<h1 title="">ROME</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I</span>
    <br><span class="h2line2">INTRODUCTORY</span></h2>
<p>Let us suppose an ordinary Englishman,
    with no special knowledge of classical history,
    to be looking at a collection of Roman antiquities
    in the cases of a museum. He will
    probably not linger long over these cases, but
    will pass on to something more likely to
    attract his interest. The objects he is looking
    at are, for the most part, neither striking
    nor beautiful, and the same are presented for
    his inspection over and over again as collections
    from various Roman sites. They
    are chiefly useful things, implements and
    utensils of all kinds, and fragments of military
    weapons and armour. In the coins he can
    take no delight, because, apart from the fact
    that, uninterpreted, they have no tale to tell
    him, they do not excite his admiration by
    beauty of design and workmanship. If, indeed,
    <span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
    he were visiting a museum at Rome, he
    would find plenty of beautiful things in it;
    but these are works of Greek artists, imported
    by wealthy or tasteful Romans in the later
    ages of Rome’s history. A typical collection
    of genuine Roman antiquities would probably
    have the effect I describe. Utility, not
    beauty, would seem to have been the motive of
    the people who left these things behind them.</p>
<p>The same motive will also be suggested to
    us if we visit any of the larger Roman works
    either in this country or on the Continent.
    Most of us know the look of a Roman road
    running straight over hill and valley, and
    meant mainly for military purposes, to enable
    troops to move rapidly and to survey the
    country as they marched. In the towns which
    have been excavated, we usually find that the
    most spacious and striking buildings must
    have been the meeting-halls (<i>basilicæ</i>), in
    which business of all kinds was transacted,
    and especially business connected with law
    and government. Very often, though not in
    the comparatively poor province of Britain,
    this characteristic of utility is combined with
    another—solidity and imposing size. In this
    well-watered island the Romans did not need
    <span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
    aqueducts to bring a constant supply of
    water to their towns, but in Italy and the
    south of France these great works are sometimes
    unnecessarily huge and imposing. Even
    when they left the path of strict utility, as in
    their triumphal arches and gateways, for
    which we must go to Trier in Germany, or to
    Orange in the south of France, or to Italy itself,
    they held strongly to the principles of
    solidity and imposing size. A writer who
    knew their art well has said that their notion
    of the highest of all things, their <i>summum
        bonum</i>, was not the beautiful, but the powerful,
    and that they thought they had as a
    people received this notion from heaven.</p>
<p>It would, indeed, be wrong to say that there
    is no beauty in Roman art; but it is quite in
    accordance with what has just been said,
    that even in the best of it there is a strong
    tendency to realism, to matter of fact. In
    their sculpture they were especially strong in
    portraiture, and in depicting scenes of human
    life they never or rarely idealise. A battle
    scene, or a picture on stone of life in a city,
    is crowded with figures, just because it really
    was so, and the work is without that restfulness
    for the eye which the perfect grouping
    <span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
    of a Greek artist so often supplies. So, too,
    in literature; all their greatest poetry has a
    strictly practical object, and bears directly on
    human life. The great philosophical poem of
    Lucretius was meant to rescue the Romans
    from religious superstition; the object of the
    <i>Æneid</i> of Virgil, of which I shall have more
    to say in another chapter, was to recall the
    degenerate Roman of that day to the sense
    of duty in the home and in the State. Their
    one original invention in literary form was
    satire, by which they meant comment,
    friendly or hostile, on the human life around
    them. Their myths and legends, of which
    there was no such abundant crop as in Greece,
    dealt chiefly with the founding of cities, or
    with the heroic deeds of human beings.<a class="fn" id="fr_1"
                                             href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56630/56630-h/56630-h.htm#fn_1">[1]</a>
    On
    the whole they excelled most in oratory and
    history; and their prose came to perfection
    earlier than their poetry.</p>
<p>One other feature of their character shall be
    mentioned here, which is entirely in keeping
    with the rest, and often escapes notice. If in
    the works of their hands and their brains they
    <span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
    were not an imaginative people, we can well
    understand that they had not this gift in
    practical life. Imagination in action takes
    the form of adventurousness, as we may see
    in our own history; the literary imaginativeness
    of Elizabethan England has its counterpart
    in the adventurous voyages of Elizabethan
    seamen. The Romans were not an
    adventurous people; they were not imaginative
    enough to be so. They penetrated, indeed,
    into unknown countries; Cæsar reached
    Britain and bridged the Rhine, but that great
    man, a true Roman born, had a temperament
    rather scientific than romantic. He did as
    almost all conquering Romans had done
    before him, and were to do after him—he
    advanced solidly, making his way safe behind
    him and feeling carefully in front of him.
    His book about his wars in Gaul was written
    without a touch of imagination, and for
    strictly practical purposes. There is, indeed,
    in the generation before Cæsar, an exception
    so striking that it may be said to prove the
    rule; he who reads Plutarch’s charming life
    of Sertorius, an Italian from the mountains
    of central Italy, will find both romance and
    adventure in his story.</p>
