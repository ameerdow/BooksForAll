<h2>PREFACE<br>
    <small>TO THE FIRST EDITION (1905)</small>
</h2>
<hr class="full">

<p>The greater part of the following matter
    has already appeared in various periodicals�the
    <cite>Fortnightly Review</cite>, the <cite>Contemporary
        Review</cite>, the <cite>Speaker</cite>, the
    <cite>Chord</cite>, the New York <cite>Musical Courier</cite>, the
    <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>, the <cite>Weekly Critical Review</cite>,
    the <cite>Monthly Musical Record</cite>, and the <cite>Daily
        Mail</cite>. All have been greatly altered, however�some
    practically rewritten. The larger articles�those
    on Programme Music, Strauss, and Berlioz�have
    been made up from sundry articles that
    appeared at different times and in different
    journals; any one who has tried to weld heterogeneous
    material of this kind into one mass will
    appreciate the difficulty of the work, and will, I
    trust, make allowances for whatever awkwardness
    of form the essays may show here and there.</p>

<p>I must apologise for the fact that occasionally
    one essay touches slightly upon ground that has
    already been more fully treated in another. It
    sometimes happens that two quite different lines
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
    of thought, starting from widely separated points,
    will converge and meet; or, on the other hand,
    that the one �sthetic principle will prove applicable
    to different phenomena. I am conscious of
    this occasional overlapping in the essays, but
    there seemed no way of avoiding it; if an argument
    was to have its proper force it had to be
    given in full, even if for a page or so it duplicated
    what had already been said elsewhere.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to the Editors of the
    journals I have named for their permission to
    reprint.</p>

<h2>PREFACE<br>
    <small>TO THE SECOND EDITION</small>
</h2>
<hr class="full">

<p>As this Second Edition is printed from
    moulds, no alteration of or addition to
    the text of the First Edition has been
    possible. I should have liked to expand
    one or two of the essays at various points and
    to revise them at others. There is always something
    new to be said, for example, about programme
    music, while any article on a living
    subject, such as that on Strauss, is bound to
    contain many things that are not so apposite
    now as when they were first written. But even
    these may have a value as pictures of a bygone
    state of things; and in this way such matter as
    that relating to the earlier attitude of the critics
    and the public towards Strauss may be of some
    historical interest. The Strauss article obviously
    needs bringing up to date. But even if that
    were done, the new article would in turn be
    behind the times in another year or two; while
    the reader will find a further discussion of
    Strauss, and a consideration of the trend of his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
    art since the <cite>Symphonia Domestica</cite>, in my little
    book on him in the series of "Living Masters of
    Music." The Appendix to the present volume
    is wholly new.</p>

<h2>PREFACE<br>
    <small>TO THE THIRD EDITION</small>
</h2>
<hr class="full">

<p>A preface to the third edition can in
    the nature of things be little more than
    a repetition of that to the second. While
    in one way it is regrettable that the
    article on Strauss does not carry us further than
    the <em>Symphonia Domestica</em>, that work, after all,
    is the most convenient and the most logical
    closing point for a study of him in all but his
    very latest activities. It is about seven years
    now since he launched out upon a new sea with
    <em>Salome</em>. With that and the operas that followed
    it he has made a new "period" in his artistic
    history. The best time, however, for critically
    appraising what he has done in the theatre will
    be when he comes out of it, and lets us see what
    influence his operatic methods and ideals have
    had on his musical thinking as a whole. He is
    said to have been engaged for some time on
    a "Nature" Symphony. The appearance of
    that or of some other purely instrumental work
    will give the opportunity for a rounded study of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
    the later Strauss, who has made even his own
    earlier works seem rather far-off things.</p>

<p>The Appendix to the volume remains as in the
    second edition. No occasion has been given me
    to pursue the subject further.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">BERLIOZ, ROMANTIC AND CLASSIC</h2>

<hr class="full">

<h3>I</h3>

<p>It is fairly safe to say that�with the possible
    exception of Liszt�there is no musician
    about whom people differ so strongly as
    about Berlioz. His case is, indeed, unique.
    We are pretty well agreed as to the relative
    positions of the other men; roughly speaking,
    all cultivated musicians would put Wagner and
    Brahms and Beethoven in the first rank of
    composers, and Mendelssohn, Grieg, and Dvo&#345;�k
    in the second or third. Even in the case of
    a disputed problem like Strauss, the argument
    among those who know his work is not, I take
    it, as to his being a musician of the first rank,
    but as to the precise position he occupies among
    the others of that limited regiment. Upon
    Berlioz, however, the world seems unable to
    make up its mind. The dispute here is not as
    to where he stands among the great ones, but
    whether he really belongs to the great ones at
    all. Though there is no absolute unanimity of
    opinion upon the total work of, say, Wagner or
    Beethoven�no complete agreement as to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
    amount of weakness that is bound up with their
    strength�there is at all events perfect unanimity
    of opinion that Wagner and Beethoven are of
    the royal line. But we have Berlioz extolled to
    the skies by one section of competent musicians,
    while another section can scarcely speak of him
    politely; he really seems to create a kind of
    physical nausea in them; and some of them
    even deny his temperament to have been really
    musical. There is surely nothing in the history
    of music to parallel the situation. The difference
    of opinion upon him, be it observed, is quite
    another thing from the frequent and quite
    excusable perplexity that men feel over a
    <em>contemporary</em> composer. Men drift widely apart
    over Wagner while he is alive; but the next
    generation, at all events, sees him practically
    through the same eyes. The quarrel over
    Berlioz is not a contemporary quarrel; the bulk
    of his most significant work had all appeared
    before 1850, and yet here we are, half a century
    after that time, still debating whether he is really
    one of the immortals. For many people Schumann's
    old question, "Are we to regard him as
    a genius, or only a musical adventurer?" still
    remains unanswered.</p>
